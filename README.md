# PSchool Generic Curriculum (PGC)

_Note: This project is in the early stage._

## Brief History

In Jan 2018, we started PSchool App as a simple web app where the students can
practice what they learn in the classroom. As teachers, we observed students
forget what they learn in the classroom after a week or a month. So we build an
App that students can practice the concepts and retain their learning. PSchool
means Practice School.

## Our Mantras

```
No Student Left Behind.
Every thing is Teachable. Everyone is Teachable.
Practice make the learning Permanent.
```

## Why PSchool Generic Curriculum (PGC)?

Just like generic medicine, we need generic curriculum for teaching subjects
like maths, english & science.

This allows teachers and parents to get assess to quality curriculum and
content.

We define the content in layman's term so that it is easy to follow for
everyone.

This curriculum is not rigid and we encourage experts to have discussion around
the various points, so that it evolves over a period of time.

Diversity in the approach is encouraged. There are multiple ways to approach a
problem.

## Prerequisite Mapping

Some students are not able to do well because pre-requisites are not met. For
example, if the students are not comfortable with tables, they cannot do
multiplications. To address this, each learning unit should be mapped with a
list of pre-requisites.

## Zero to Hero

We need to scientifically order the content so that we can take students from
level zero to level 100, one step at a time.

## Parent Friendly

We want to define the curriculum and content in a simple way so that parents,
senior students should be able to follow it.

## Result Oriented

We don't prescribe or discuss teaching methodologies. Instead we focus on what
the student should learn. How the student is taught is upto the teacher.

Eg:

1. What are the 3-letter words that a 5-year-old should be familiar with?
2. List of 100 simple antonyms for class-2
3. Simple addition problems for class-3
4. Short paragraphs on 10 leaders for class-4
