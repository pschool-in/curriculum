### Calamities 
Some events that occur cause great damage to human life and property. Such events and situations are called emergencies or calamities. When they are caused by natural factors we call them natural calamities.

### Fire
In case of fire:
1.	There will be a long bell. Listen to it.
2.	 Keep calm and do not shout.  
3.	Shut down all the windows.
4.	Walk out of the building and do not run.
5.	Move to an open ground away from the fire.

### Earthquake
In case of earthquake:
1.	Keep calm and walk out of the building.
2.	Use the stairs to go down.
3.	Go to an open ground where nothing can fall on you.
4.	If you cannot go out, then you must sit under furniture as a table.
5.	If you are outdoors, do not enter a building immediately after the earthquake stops.
6.	Beware of aftershocks.

### Tsunami
Before a tsunami strikes, the water in the sea usually retreats by almost a mile. If you are on a beach or coastal area when the water retreats, immediately rush towards land. Run as far as possible from the sea.

### Cyclone and Floods
Cyclone prone India states are Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, Assam, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Floods can also be caused by a cyclone.

### Drought
Drought prone areas in India are Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu.

### Disaster Management 
Advances in technology have made it possible to warn people about some disasters beforehand and to help minimise the damage caused. Floods, cyclones, droughts and sometimes tsunamis can be predicted. This knowledge helps us save many lives.
After the disaster the government sets up relief camps for the affected people and provides food, drinking water and bedding. The army is also called in to airlift stranded people and airdrop food. Emergency services are alerted immediately. Medicines are provided to the people as there is a high risk of an outbreak of diseases. Organizations such as the Red Cross Society and World Health Organization provide voluntary services. People from all over the country donate to relief funds.
