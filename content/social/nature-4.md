## Chapter: maha g4: Are we endangering the environment?

### How we harm our environment?

1. Vehicles like motor-cars, buses and scooters that run on mineral oil were invented to make transport easier.
2. We build trains.
3. We build dams, roads and railways.
4. We set up factories and build houses.
5. We release waste water from factories into rivers. 
6. Cities became crowded as people left their villages in search for work.
7. Trees were cut down to build new houses. 
8. The number of vehicles increased. 
9. Smoke began to cause breathing disorders.
10. As trees are felled, birds do not find nesting places.  
11. Greater is the demand for food grain. 
12. The demand for water increases.
13. Previously, the waterwheel was used to draw well water. Now, pumps are used, so groundwater gets used up rapidly.

All these activities harm the environment either directly or indirectly.
