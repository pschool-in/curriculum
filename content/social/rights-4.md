## Rights and Duties of Children - Reading

### Citizen
A citizen is a person who is a member of a country. A citizen enjoys the rights given to him/her by the country.

### Constitution
There are rules that all citizens of the country have to follow. The constitution of India sets these rules. The set of rules of a country is known as the constitution. The constitution lays down certain rules to help the country work together smoothly. 

The Indian constitution is the lengthiest in the world. The original document was handwritten. If a foreigner stays in India for 12 years, they can get Indian citizenship.

### Child Rights
All over the world, there are different policies and rights. Children have certain rights to ensure that every child is treated the same. These are practiced to create a healthy environment for the children to live in.

All over the world, there are many countries which have agreed to make some basic rights for children. India is one of them.

The four major child rights are: 
1. Right to survival 
2. Right to development 
3. Right to protection 
4. Right to participation

### Right to Survival
It is to ensure every child has access to minimum standards of food. This helps in healthy growth in all children. There are different rights for children below the age of 6 and between the age of 6-14 years. This is because both age groups have different needs for their growth and development.

###  WASH program
It is a part of the right to survival act. WASH stands for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene. It means there should be access to clean water for drinking and other needs. Many diseases spread through water. To avoid these, having access to safe water is very important. Spreading awareness to washing hands with soap is also a part of the WASH program. 

### Right to Development
Every child has the right to go to school and develop life skills. All children below 14 years have the right to go to school. The government is responsible for providing free education to all. 

### Child Labour
Children are sometimes involved in different works at different places. This is called Child Labour. It is illegal to force children below the age of 14 to work. If we see any children forced to work around us then we should call the Childline number 1098 [Ten Nine Eight] and inform. 

You can call at any time and it is free of cost. If you see child labor, talk to him/ her first. If they are forced to do the job, you can call the number and inform them. They will come and help the child.

### Right to Protection
Children have the right to be protected in all circumstances. The Indian government has set laws for the same. There are laws to punish people who touch children inappropriately. All you need to do is, keep an eye out for danger and be confident. There is another rule, no person should hit or harm children. It is wrong to hit children, as it affects their well-being. 

Elders should help to create a safe environment for children to live in.

### Right to Participate
Children have the right to participate in matters related to them. This includes asking questions, giving suggestions and making decisions in things that affect them.

Children have the right to participate in discussions and implementation of all things related to them.
