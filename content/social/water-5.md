# Chapter maha g3: Water
## Reading
### Pollution of water
Water is polluted when other substances get mixed in it. Some float on its surface while some dissolve in it. This makes the water unfit and unhealthy for drinking.
### Disposal of waste water
Waste water is impure water and thus is polluted. Sewage water carries microbes that spread diseases. Waste water from industries can also be poisonous. If we mix this waste water into our water sources like oceans, rivers, and seas, then it will be a big problem for us.
This is why all industries must treat the waste water before releasing it. Similarly, sewage is also purified before releasing the water into a water body. Likewise, water is purified before being supplied across the town.
### Mineral water
It is conveniently available in general stores and stations. The bottles are packed and sealed. We should always check the date of sealing and the date of expiry printed on the neck of the bottle before buying it.
Checking for dates is important for not just mineral water bottles but other packed edibles like food and medicines.
### Famine
Places with least or no rainfall face scarcity of water, which further leads to drought. 
When there is no water to drink, bathe, cook and for agriculture, this condition is called famine.
The government moves people from the affected areas to a safer place, temporarily.
### Do you know?
1. Air and water are mixed with the help of pumps. This leads to the dissolution of oxygen in the water. The process is called oxygenation.

2. In chlorination, chlorine is mixed in water to kill the germs present in it.
