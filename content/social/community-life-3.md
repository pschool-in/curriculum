## Chapter: mahag3: Public Services for Community Life
## Public Services - Reading
### Community Life
In a home, we live with our family. Our life outside the home is our public life. Several services are required for public life to go on smoothly. Public facilities are those services that are available to all of us. We use several such services like transport, schools and hospitals. Public services are equally available to all and are meant for everybody. We must use them responsibly.

### Local Government 
We live in cities or villages. The population of cities is large whereas, in
villages, it is quite small. In cities, there are factories, markets and greater chances for employment. Cities have public services on a large scale.
The administration of a place, be it a city or a village, is run by the government in that place. It is known as local government.

A gram panchayat runs the administration of a village.

A municipality runs the administration of a town and for big cities, there is
a municipal corporation.

### Public Services
Public services are provided to us out of the money collected from us as taxes. We must use them carefully. The local government provides the services of water supply and public hygiene. The postal service is useful for keeping in touch with our friends and relatives. Letters can be sent to any part of the world.

### Co - Operatives
The people in a locality sometimes come together and find out what the local needs are. Based on their findings, they decide to start an industry or service in co-operation with one other. They contribute some of their own money to start that industry or service. The profits are distributed among everyone. Institutions formed by peopleâ€™s cooperation are called co-operatives.
