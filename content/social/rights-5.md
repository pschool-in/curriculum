### Who is human?
Man is a social animal. Human beings are bestowed with senses. Human beings think and act using their senses. They are born free but bound in the social web. They cannot live alone. They need social and emotional support. To live in society they need to develop some good values.

### Aim of Education
We are born with few values and rights. These values are further polished in educational institutions. Education aims to change a person into a valuable person. 

### Good Values
Good values are the qualities of a person that keep society running. These qualities can be developed by all. People should live together in unity. Living together in harmony despite all the disparities is a significant value. Helping others is also an important value. There should be no disparity among people and all are one. Moral and good values have to be grown among children so that they may become valuable citizens.

The five major values are: 

1. Personal Value: Personal value is the basic value for every individual.
