### Olden day Schools
In the olden days in our country, students used to go to their teacher’s house to receive an education. They lived there for a few years and completed their education. In the later period, a teacher and students of different ages came together. The teacher would then teach the students. Students traced letters and numbers on the ground. In this period, opportunities for girls’ education were very rare. When the British introduced the present school system, Mahatma Phule and Krantijyoti Savitribai Phule began in Pune, to
educate girls.

### Changes in School System
Earlier, schools were held in every town and village. In villages, students gathered under a large banyan tree or in a shady place,
where one teacher taught students of different ages. They were taught reading, writing and simple arithmetic. When the British came to India, they introduced the modern school system. Our people realized that there can be no progress without education. People began to come forward to send their children to school. This is how the present-day schools were formed.

### School
In school, we learn how to keep ourselves clean. We also learn the importance of keeping public places clean. Personal and public hygiene helps to keep us healthy. We all like school. A school has facilities like a library, playground and computer lab which we all use. Everyone should be able to use these facilities. We should follow certain rules while using these facilities. We should wait in queues. Books borrowed from the library should be returned on time. We should not tear or damage the
pages of the books. We must keep the walls and benches in the classroom clean. We must return the sports equipment to its proper place after using it.

Quarrels may arise between friends, but they should be resolved amicably. Every person who is quarreling should get a chance to present their side. Quarrels should not lead to physical fights. The teacher should be asked to help if a quarrel cannot be resolved. Resolving quarrels peacefully is a good way to end them. It teaches us to solve problems in community life amicably. If issues in community life are resolved peacefully, many of our problems will be solved.

Each child must get the opportunity to attend school. School is for everyone. We learn how to get along with others at school. We get to know a lot of people. At school, we realize that we are a part of society.

## Chapter: mahag3: Our Community Life
## Our Community Life - Reading
### Community
We like the company of other people. At home, we live with our parents. We also have neighbors. We miss our friends if we can’t meet them. We miss even our pets when they are not around.
People like to live in groups. Living in the company of our family, neighbors and other people means living in a community. In a community, we get companions. We feel secure in their company.
We help them and they, too, help us. This is known as co-operation.
Mutual co-operation is the greatest benefit of community life. Rules are needed to build this co-operation.

Our daily needs are fulfilled in a community. Education and health
facilities for everyone can be developed in a community. Goods have
to be produced to satisfy needs. This is called the production of goods. The process of reaching those goods to people is called service. Production and service are both necessary to satisfy needs. Many people contribute to this. One person cannot produce everything; neither can he give all services by himself. Community life is interdependent.

### Rules in a Community
Before playing any game, we must first understand its rules. The rules of the game are the same for everybody. Every player has to follow the rules. Only then does the game go on smoothly. Similarly, to make sure that community life also goes on smoothly, we must follow the rules. Games have an important place in our lives. We imbibe the qualities of cooperation and unity through games. Participation, determination and passion are more important in games than winning or losing.
