## Reading

### What is Time?

Time is an infinite continuous progress of events from the past, through the present, to the future. It is majorly divided into three parts.

1. Past - Event that has happened.

2. Present - Event that is happening.

3. Future- Event that is going to happen. 

To calculate and understand time, we are using certain units like a clock, calendars, etc. The clock contains seconds, minutes, and hours. Calendars are there to make a log of time. The calendar contains days, months, and years. These are all units of time, that help us to measure and calculate the time. In ancient days, people used a water clock, an hourglass, etc. Statues, historical places, monuments, coins, shards of pottery, old objects, etc. So this helps us to understand the history of those things.
