## Changes in Family and Neighborhood - Reading
### Changes in Family
Each family may have a different number of people. This number does not remain the same. As time passes, it may increase or decrease. Marriage is one reason for such a loss or gain. The number of people in a family also changes due to births and deaths. A family grows when the new generation is born. When members of a family pass away due to reasons like old age, illness or accidents, the number of its members is reduced.

### Migration
Sometimes, children in a family go to other places for their education. Also, some members take up jobs or occupations in other places. Moving from one place to another to live there is called migration. Thus due to migration, marriages, births and deaths, the number of people in a family goes on changing. It is not only in our family that we see these changes. They occur in the entire society.

### Migration in Birds
Many birds migrate in search of food and shelter. Every year they migrate from one place to another at a fixed time. Some birds fly far away, while others do not go very far. Birds fly in a flock. Even though they stay together in a flock, they do not have families or neighbors like human beings!

### Staying in Touch
When a member of the family goes far away for some reason, he stays in touch with the family through letters, telephone calls and now, the internet. These modern means of communication have brought the world closer together.

### Changing Family System
From ancient times to the present, the nature of a family has undergone many changes. When a man took up agriculture for his livelihood he settled down in one place. A lot of people are required to do the work needed in agriculture. Therefore, many relations stayed together and formed a big family. As the family grew, it became impossible to feed everyone through farming alone. Trade and other new occupations developed. Cities began to grow. People began to migrate to places where they could find work. Big families were scattered into many small families.

In recent years, the number of people going to other States and countries for work and education has increased greatly. Many families have one of their members living abroad or in another city in our own country. Therefore, the family system is also changing.

### Neighborhood
Apart from our family, we also have daily contact with our neighbors. We live in the same locality. We need each otherâ€™s help to solve problems of garbage, security, water and electricity. In times of need, it is our neighbors who help us till our relatives can reach us. Due to the help we give each other, our relations with our neighbors become friends.
Friendly and harmonious relations make for joyful community life.
