## Changes in Family and Neighborhood - Reading
### Changes in Family
Each family may have a different number of people. This number does not remain the same. As time passes, it may increase or decrease. Marriage is one reason for such a loss or gain. The number of people in a family also changes due to births and deaths. A family grows when the new generation is born. When members of a family pass away due to reasons like old age, illness or accidents, the number of its members is reduced.

### Migration
Sometimes, children in a family go to other places for their education. Also, some members take up jobs or occupations in other places. Moving from one place to another to live there is called migration. Thus due to migration, marriages, births and deaths, the number of people in a family goes on changing. It is not only in our family that we see these changes. They occur in the entire society.

### Migration in Birds
Many birds migrate in search of food and shelter. Every year they migrate from one place to another at a fixed time. Some birds fly far away, while others do not go very far. Birds fly in a flock. Even though they stay together in a flock, they do not have families or neighbors like human beings!

### Staying in Touch
When a member of the family goes far away for some reason, he stays in touch with the family through letters, telephone calls and now, the internet. These modern means of communication have brought the world closer together.

### Changing Family System
From ancient times to the present, the nature of a family has undergone many changes. When a man took up agriculture for his livelihood he settled down in one place. A lot of people are required to do the work needed in agriculture. Therefore, many relations stayed together and formed a big family. As the family grew, it became impossible to feed everyone through farming alone. Trade and other new occupations developed. Cities began to grow. People began to migrate to places where they could find work. Big families were scattered into many small families.

In recent years, the number of people going to other States and countries for work and education has increased greatly. Many families have one of their members living abroad or in another city in our own country. Therefore, the family system is also changing.

### Neighborhood
Apart from our family, we also have daily contact with our neighbors. We live in the same locality. We need each other’s help to solve problems of garbage, security, water and electricity. In times of need, it is our neighbors who help us till our relatives can reach us. Due to the help we give each other, our relations with our neighbors become friends.
Friendly and harmonious relations make for joyful community life.

## My Delightful School - Reading
### My Delightful School
We get many different friends in school. We study with each other’s help. We play together and share our tiffins. We take part in school functions and go on trips together. We come together to clean and decorate the classroom. There are so many things which we do together.

If we help each other, we can succeed at anything. Work becomes enjoyable. We all wear a uniform in school. However, on days when the uniform is not compulsory, the classroom becomes colorful. It is fun to attend a class where there is a lot of diversity. Our customs, languages and eating habits may be different, but as human beings, we are all alike. When we respect this diversity and help each other, we enjoy being in school. School becomes delightful. In school, we come to know about the diversity in our country.

Every child should get the joy of learning in school. All children with special needs have the right to education. Many parents of children with special needs send their children to school with great determination. The government also has many schemes for them.

When we offer and seek help, learning becomes more enjoyable.

## Chapter: mahag4: I’ll be responsible and sensitive
## I’ll be responsible and sensitive - Reading
### Caring for the elderly 
We all either live with or are related to old people. They love us and pamper us. However, they cannot run about and play like us. They often need small tasks done for them like fetching medicine or other products from the market, removing things from lofts or threading needles. If we carry out these tasks for them, it is of great help to them. If the TV or music is played loudly, it can be very disturbing for them. At such times, we must lower the volume.

Grandparents are often at home all day. Their only pastime is talking to their children and grandchildren. They are curious about what their grandchildren do at school all day. They have great affection for us. They feel happy when we speak to them lovingly.

### Special needs people
Some people have physical handicaps because of illnesses or accidents or, they may be born with them. They suffer many inconveniences and much discomfort in public places. That is why they require special services and assistance.

Blind people can walk about in public places freely with the help of the
white cane. In some buildings, the floor numbers on lifts are written in Braille. That helps a blind person to go to any floor they wish without help. A blind person can also vote secretly like other citizens because of Braille signs on voting machines.

In schools, universities and some other buildings, you may have seen a
concrete slope next to the stairs. This slope is called a ramp. The ramp makes it possible for people in wheelchairs to enter the building. Some buildings also have special toilets for people in wheelchairs. These facilities exist so that people with special needs can live their daily
lives easily. However, these facilities are not available everywhere. We must treat people with special needs with care, whether these facilities exist in public places or not.

Blind people can read and write by using their sense of touch. This system of writing is called Braille. Braille characters make use of raised dots created on paper. Each character has a fixed number and arrangement of dots. A blind person can read the paper by feeling these raised dots. However, all of the books written in the ordinary script are not available in Braille. Blind persons can listen to the stories if they are readout.

People who cannot hear use sign language. They are also taught how to lip-read to follow what other people are saying. They can follow other people’s speech if they speak slowly and clearly. Special signed news programs are broadcast on television for people who cannot hear.
