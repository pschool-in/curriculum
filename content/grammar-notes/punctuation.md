# Full stop (Period)

We use a full stop or period at the end of a statement. For example,

1. I like eating apples.
2. My mom wakes up at 6 o’clock in the morning.
3. I go to school every day.

We also use period in front of abbreviations. For example,

1. Mr. Malik
2. Mrs. Sharma
3. Ms. Shivani

# Exclamation mark

(grade-2)

It is used to show strong feelings of joy, sadness, confusion, surprise, etc.
This mark can be used after a word, phrase or sentence. The sentences ending
with an exclamation mark are called exclamatory sentences. A few examples of
such sentences are:

1. Alas! My holidays are canceled.
2. Wow, it’s raining!
3. Oh God!
4. I hear thunder!

## Capital letters

The first letter of a sentence should always be capital. The word ‘I’ is also
written in capital. In addition, names of special places, people and titles also
start with a capital letter. Some examples are;

1. My name is Richa.
2. May I eat some fish?
3. Richa Malhotra
4. Mrs. Kapoor

# Apostrophe/Contraction

An apostrophe is used for making a contraction. A contraction is made by
combining two words into one. We put an apostrophe in place of a missing letter.
Some examples are;

1. do+not= don’t
2. are+not= aren’t
3. can+not= can’t

# Comma

We put a comma in the date and after greeting and closing in a letter. For
example:

1. October 21, 2021
2. Dear Mary, I am…
3. Yours truly, Shaan

We also put commas in between the series of words. For example:

1. I like eating grapes, cabbage, and noodles.
2. I have a pencil, crayons, and eraser in my box.
3. He bought new clothes, shoes, and a bag.

# Question mark

We put a question mark at the end of a sentence that asks a question. For
example:

1. May I come in?
2. Are you going to the party?
3. How old are you?
