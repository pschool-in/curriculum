# Negative Sentence

## Notes

### Negative and Positive sentences

A negative sentence usually has any of the below words in it.

```
not, never, no, no one, nobody, none, isn't, can't, won't
```

If a sentence does not have any of the above words, then it is a positive
sentence. A sentence can be created in two ways. For example, the below two
sentences have the same meaning.

```
The jug has no water.
The jug is empty.
```

The first sentence is known as negative sentence and the second sentence is
known as positive sentence.

### some vs any

We use 'some' in positive statements and 'any' in negative statements.

We use 'some' when we request for something or offer something.

```
Can I borrow some money?
Would you like some tea?
```

We use 'any' when asking a question.

```
Do you have any pen?
```

### Contractions

In everyday speech and informal writing we use contractions.

"are not" becomes "aren't"

"is not" becomes "isn't"

"I am" becomes "I'm"

"We are" becomes "We're"
