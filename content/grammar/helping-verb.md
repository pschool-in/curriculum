# Helping verbs

## Notes

A helping verb is used with a main verb to help express the main verb's tense,
mood, or voice.

### Be verbs

They are used to describe the condition of people, things, places and ideas.

```
am, is, are, was, were,
being, been, will be
```

### Have verbs

They can be used both main verb and helping verb. If used as a main verb, then
it indicates possession. eg: I have a cycle. We use **have** helping verb to
make **perfect tense**.

```
has, have, had
having, will have
```

### Do verbs

They can be used both as main and helping verb. If used as a main verb, then it
indicates action. eg: **Can you do a help?**

We use have helping verb to ask questions. We also use them for more emphatic or
deliberate actions.

### Other common helping verbs

```

### Negatives

```

don't, doesn't
```

### Third person singular

pronoun. It applies to helping verbs too. Find below some helping verbs and
