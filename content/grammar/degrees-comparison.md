# Degrees of Comparison

The Degrees of Comparison in English grammar are made with the Adjective and Adverb words to
show the qualities of noun(person,place,things)

Some Adjectives:
Small, big, large, beautiful, fast, wise, healthy, easy, good .

Some Adverbs:
Slowly, beautifully, easily. quickly, badly, eagerly.

Every adjective and adverb can be written in one of three degrees:
1. Positive degree
2. Comparative degree
3. Superlative degree

1.The Positive Degree:
The positive degree of an adjective or adverb offers no comparison.
Keypoint :

➢ [only adjective word used without “er, est, more and most” ]
➢ ...as+adjective+as
➢ ...so+adjective+as

Example:

■ Vijay is a tall boy
■ Priya is a beautiful girl in her class.
■ Jeni is as clever as janu

2. The Comparative Degree:

This compares two things to show which has the lesser or greater degree of the

quality.
Keypoint:

● [add “er” (one syllable word) and Add “More” (more than one syllable) to an
adjective to form the comparative degree.
● [adjective+than- is used in comparative degree]

Example:

● Balu is taller than Ramu

4. The Superlative Degree:
This compares more than two things to show which has the least or greatest degree of the
quality.
Keypoint:
● Add “est” (one syllable word) and Add “Most” (more than one syllable) to an
adjective to form the superlative degree.
● (the+adjective)- is used in comparative degree
