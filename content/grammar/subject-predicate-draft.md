# Subject and Predicate

## Notes

Every sentence has two parts: a subject and a predicate.

The subject is what (or whom) the sentence is about.

The predicate tells something about the subject.

In the below sentences, the highlighted part is subject and the remaining is predicate.

eg:

_**John**_ plays cricket.

_**Rabbits**_ like carrot.

_**It**_ is raining.

_**I**_ like dogs.

Subjects can be made up of more than one words too.

_**The children**_ played in the field.

_**Sam and John**_ are best friends.

The above sentence is not about 'Sam' or 'John' alone. It is about both of them.

_**My dad's cell phone ringtone**_ is funny.

The above sentence is not about 'dad' or 'cell phone'. It is about the ringtone. The other words are modifiers of 'ringtone'.

Usually the subject comes at the beginning of a sentence, but sometimes it comes at the end.

Out of the woods came _**a tiger**_.

Up and down went _**the swing**_.

Down the road ran _**the little boy**_.
