# Types of Sentence

### (sentence-2)

```
A sentence is usually a group of words connected to form a meaningful idea. Any written text is made up of a collection of sentences. Sentences can be classified into 4 types.
# Declarative
A declarative sentence simply makes a statement or expresses an opinion. In other words, it just declares something. This is the most common and frequently used type of sentence. eg:
I am reading a book.
# Imperative
An imperative sentence gives a command or makes a request. Usually, in imperative sentences, the subject is hidden and understood. eg:
Please sit down.
# Interrogative
An interrogative sentence asks a question. It usually ends with a question mark. eg:
What is your name?
# Exclamatory
An exclamatory sentence is a sentence that expresses great emotion such as excitement, surprise, happiness and anger, and ends with an exclamation point. eg:
Wow! I really like it!
```

### (sentence-3)

```
`Every sentence has two parts: a subject and a predicate.
The subject is what (or whom) the sentence is about.
The predicate tells something about the subject.
In the below sentences, the highlighted part is the subject and the remaining is the predicate.`,
          {
            type: 'html',
            text: `eg: <br>
<b>John</b> plays cricket.<br>
<b>Rabbits</b> like carrots.<br>
<b>It</b> is raining.<br>
<b>I</b> like dogs.`
          },
          `Subjects can be made up of more than one word too.`,
          {
            type: 'html',
            text: `eg: <br>
<b>The children</b> played in the field.<br>
<b>Sam and John</b> are best friends.`
          },
          `The above sentence is not about 'Sam' or 'John' alone. It is about both of them.`,
          {
            type: 'html',
            text: `<b>My dad's cell phone ringtone</b> is funny.`
          },
          `The above sentence is not about 'dad' or 'cell phone'. It is about the ringtone. The other words are modifiers of 'ringtone'.
Usually, the subject comes at the beginning of a sentence, but sometimes it comes at the end.`,
          {
            type: 'html',
            text: `Out of the woods came <b>a tiger</b>.<br>
Up and down went <b>the swing</b>.<br>
Down the road ran <b>the little boy</b>.`
```

## Types of sentences

We have already learned about statements and orders. When it comes to the types
of sentences, 'statements' are called declarative sentences and
'orders/commands' are called imperative sentences.

Examples of different types of sentences are:

1. Declarative sentences a. He is a good boy. b. I wake up early in the morning.
   c. The sun rises in the east.

2. Imperative sentences a. Come in. b. Sit down. c. Play the music.

3. Interrogative a. What is your name? b. Where are you? c. Where is my mother?

4. Exclamatory a. What a pleasant day! b. Alas! He is hurt. c. The movie was
   amazing!

## Subject-verb agreement

We know that subject is anything that we are talking about. On the other hand, a
verb is a word that describes any action.

Subject-verb agreement means that in a sentence, the subject and verb should
agree with each other in terms of number. It means that if the subject is
singular, then the verb used will be singular. And if the subject is plural,
then the verb will also be plural. Example:

1. I like to study.

In this sentence, the subject 'I' is singular, so the verb 'like' is also
singular.

2. You are my best friend.

In this sentence, the subject 'you' is singular, so the verb 'are' is also
singular.

3. I sleep at 8 o'clock.

In this sentence, the subject 'I' is singular, so the verb 'sleep' is also
singular.

## Exception

There is an exception in the subject-verb agreement. If the subject is a 3rd
person singular, then the verb used will be plural. Similarly, if the subject is
a 3rd person plural, then the verb will be singular. Some examples are:

1. He drinks milk.

In this sentence, the subject 'He' is a 3rd person singular. So the verb
'drinks' is plural.

2. She likes to play with dolls.

In this sentence, the subject 'She' is a 3rd person singular, so the verb
'likes' is plural.

3. Niyu hates coffee.

In this sentence, the subject 'Niyu' is a 3rd person singular, so the verb
'hates' is plural.

4. They like eating noodles.

In this sentence, the subject 'They' is 3rd person plural, so the verb 'like' is
singular.

5. Children love to go to school.

In this sentence, the subject 'Children' is 3rd person plural, so the verb
'love' is singular.

6. The boys like playing cricket.

In this sentence, the subject 'boys' is 3rd person plural, so the verb 'like' is
singular.
