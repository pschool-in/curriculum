# Joining Words

(conjunction-1)

Joining words are used to join two or more words and sentences. The two common
joining words are 'and' and 'but'.

'And' is used when we are adding something to our statement. For example,

1. I like to play _and_ eat.
2. I don't like spinach _and_ guava.
3. I will dance _and_ sing in the competition.

'But' is used to say something opposite. For example,

1. I want to play _but_ I haven't done my homework.
2. I want to go to the party _but_ I'm tired.
3. I like Ravi _but_ I hate his brother.

# Conjunctions

(conjunction-2) (grade2 and 3)

The word that joins two or more words or sentences is called a conjunction. In
simple words, conjunctions are joining words. The most common conjunctions are
'and', 'but', 'so' and 'or'.

For example:

'The bird can fly.' 'The bird can sing.'

These two sentences can be joined together with the help of conjunction. We can
write it as;

'The bird can fly _and_ sing.'

Some more examples are;

1. The monkey can walk _and_ climb.
2. I am eating _and_ watching TV.
3. Rahul tried to study _but_ fell asleep.
4. I want to play _but_ I need to study.
5. We can watch a movie _or_ go for lunch.
6. I will complete my HW today _or_ tomorrow.
7. My mother is late _so_ I'm waiting for her.
8. We're going to the park in the evening, _so_ I'll take a nap in the noon.
