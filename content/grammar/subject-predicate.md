# Subject and Predicate

## Notes
```
A sentence is a group pf words arranged in a particular order and has two parts, namely, a subject and a predicate which help to express a complete thought.
      For example: The children played in the field.
                   Rajini is a beautiful singer.
The subject of a sentence may be a word or a group of words that tell us who or what does something or is spoken about.
In a sentence, who or what we talk about is the subject.
In the above sentemces, 'the children' are doing sonething and 'Ranjini' is spoken about, therefore they are the subjects of the sentences.
The predicate is the part of the sentence that speaks about the subject or what the subject is doing.
The predicate always begins with the verb of the sentence. In the above sentences, 'played in the feild' and 'is a beautiful singer" are the predicates as they tell us what the subjects 'children' are doing and what is being said about the subject 'Ranjini'.
The subject is usually followed by the predicate as given in the examples above, but sometimes the subject follows the predicate, as in the sentence:
'Up and down went the swing.' Here, 'the swing'is the subject,following the predicate 'up and down went'.
