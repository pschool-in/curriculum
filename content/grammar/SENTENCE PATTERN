#SENTENCE PATTERN 
An arrangement of words is called sentence pattern.
This arrangement needs to be in a grammatically correct structure. It means the placement of verbs and nouns should be correct to form a meaningful sentence.

 Sentences are very diverse and there are actually a lot of ways to construct them.
There are five important components in a sentence.
Subject (S)
Verb (V)
Object (O)
Complement (C)
Adverbial (A)

##SUBJECT (S)
Subject (S) consists of nouns or pronouns. It occurs before a verb. To get ‘S’ ask the question ‘Who?’ before the verb.

###e.g.
```
Rani dance well (Here “Rani” - Subject)
The child broke the glass(Here “The child” - Subject)
```
##VERB (V)
Verb (V) consists of auxiliaries or finite verbs. In every sentence the most important word is the verb. A verb shows an
action or activity or work done.
###e.g.
```
He is a doctor (“Be” form verb)
Jems wrote a letter (Main verb)
The baby is crying (auxiliary verb + Main verb)
```
##OBJECT (O)
Object (O) - consists of nouns or noun phrases or noun clauses. To get the object ‘O’ ask the question ‘What (for things)’ or ‘Whom (for persons)’.
###e.g.
```
He bought a pen (a pen = Object)
He handles the computer (computer = Object)
I saw him (him = Object)
```


(a) DO
- Direct object
- answers the question ‘what’

e.g.
S V O (what)
I likes animals

(b) IO

- Indirect object
- answers the question ‘whom’

e.g.
S V IO (whom) DO
I gave Rosy a pen
4. COMPLEMENT (C)
Definition :The words required to complete the meaning of a sentence are called
Complement .
e.g.
S V C
He is a dentist
She became a journalist
It grew dark
Complement (C) - from the word ‘complete’
❖ - completes the meaning in the
sentence
❖ - wihtout it the, meaning is
incomplete
❖ - wihtout it the, meaning changes
Adjunct or Adverbial
Definition :
To get ‘A’ ask the question why, when, where or how.
e.g.
S V A
She Comes every day(when)
They ate Junk food (how)
Raju Sits here(where)
