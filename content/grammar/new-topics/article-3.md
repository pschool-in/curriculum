# Article

## Objectives

To understand the definite and indefinite articles and also to be able to identify them in the text.
To be able to identify the correct and incorrect use of articles in writing samples. 

### Reading Notes: 

Articles are of two types – the definite article (the) and the indefinite article (a/an). 

Indefinite articles: 

The indefinite articles *a/an* are generally used to mention some person or thing. 

These articles do not specify a particular person or a thing.

A and An are used to introduce noun words or naming words and are also used to mention singular countable nouns.  

*a* is used before singular nouns beginning with consonant sounds.

*an* is used before singular nouns beginning with vowel sounds.

Definite artilce: 

We use definite article *the* when we are talking about specific person or a thing. 

*the* is used for countable and uncountable nouns/singular and plural nouns.

Zero article: 

In some situations we do not use any articles at all, such situation is called as *zero article*.  

When we are talking about something in general or when we mention a city or country, we do not use articles.

Once upon a time, in *a (the, an)* thick forest, *a (the, an)* lion was sleeping under *a (an, the)* tree. 
*A (the, an)* cheerful mouse came there and saw *the (a, an)* lion.  
*The (a, an)* mouse climbed onto the body of the lion and started playing. 
He pulled *the (a, an)* lion’s whiskers. Suddenly the lion woke up and roared in anger and caught the mouse.
*The (a, an)* mouse trembled in fear. The lion took pity on it and let it go. 
The mouse thanked and promised the lion that it would help in times of need. 
One day *a (an, the)* hunter trapped *the (an, a)* lion. *The (a, an)* poor lion roared for help.  
The mouse heard the cries and came there and cut *the (a, an)* net with its sharp teeth. 
The lion came out and they became good friends. 
```

```
One afternoon *a (the, an)* fox was walking through *the (a, an)* forest and 
spotted *a (the, an)* bunch of grapes hanging from over *a (an, the)* lofty branch.
“Just *the (a, an)* right thing to quench my thirst,” he thought.
Taking a few steps back, *the (a, an)* fox jumped and just missed *the (a, an)* hanging grapes. 
Again *the (a, an)* fox took a few paces back and tried to reach them but still failed.
After *an (a, the)* hour finally *the (a, an)* fox gave up
and turned up his nose and said, “They’re probably sour anyway,” and walked away.
```

```
One hot day, *a (an, the)* thirsty crow flew all over the fields looking for water. 
For a long time, he could not find any. He felt very weak, almost lost all hope. 
Suddenly, he saw *a (an, the)* water jug below *the (a, an)* tree. 
He flew straight down to see if there was any water inside.
Yay! he could see some water inside the jug!

*The (a, an)* crow tried to push his head into the jug. 
Sadly, he found that *the (a, an)* neck of the jug was too narrow. 
Then he tried to push *the (a, an)* jug to tilt for the water to flow out, but the jug was too heavy.

*The (a, an)* crow thought hard for a while. 
Then, looking around it, he saw some pebbles.
He suddenly had *a (an, the)* good idea. 
He started picking up *the (a, an)* pebbles one by one, dropping each into the jug. 
As more and more pebbles filled *the (a, an)* jug, the water level kept rising. 
Soon it was high enough for *the (a, an)* crow to drink. His plan had worked!
