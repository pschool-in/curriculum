# Definite and Indefinite Article

## Objectives

To understand the definite and indefinite articles and also to be able to identify them in the text.
To be able to identify the correct and incorrect use of articles in writing samples. 

### Reading Notes: 

Articles are of two types – the definite article (the) and the indefinite article (a/an). 

Indefinite articles: 

The indefinite articles "a/an" are generally used to mention some person or thing. 

These articles do not specify a particular person or a thing.

"A" and "An" are used to introduce noun words or naming words and are also used to mention singular countable nouns.  

"a" is used before singular nouns beginning with consonant sounds.

"an" is used before singular nouns beginning with vowel sounds.

Definite article: 

We use definite article "the" when we are talking about a specific person or a thing. 

"the" is used for countable and uncountable nouns/singular and plural nouns.
