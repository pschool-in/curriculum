## Adverb of degree

Adverb of degree tells us to what extent the action has been done. In simple words, it answers the question 'how much?' For example:

The girl was *very* beautiful.

In this sentence, the word very tells us how much beautiful is the girl.

More examples are:
1. Ram can run *so* quickly.
2. I *really* enjoyed the ride.

Other common adverbs of degree are almost, quite, nearly, extremely, too, just, enough, hardly, almost, etc.

There are three types of adverb of degrees:

1. Positive

"The toy plane is *big*."

This sentence talks about the toy plane. Here, the toy plane is not compared to anything else. Therefore, *big* is a positive degree of comparison.

2. Comparative

"The doll is *bigger* than the plane."

In this sentence, the doll is compared to a plane. Therefore, *faster* is the comparative degree of comparison.

3. Superlative

"The teddy bear is the *biggest* of all."

In this sentence, the teddy bear, doll and toy plane are compared with each other. Teddy bear is superior to all. Therefore, *biggest* is the superlative degree of comparison.
