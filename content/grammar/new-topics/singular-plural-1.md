# Objective

To understand that when we speak about more than one person or a thing we add 'S'  to the naming word.

# Grade-1

## Singular-Plural

In simple words, singular means only one. Plural means more than one. We generally add 's' at the end of the nouns to make them plural. Some examples are:
1. The plural for an ant will be *ants*.
2. The plural for a cat will be *cats*
3. The plural for a bird will be *birds*.

Some nouns use different words as plural. Some examples are:
1. The plural for a child is *children*.
2. The plural for a tooth is *teeth*.
3. The plural for a foot is *feet*.
