# Adjective

## Learning Objective: 

To understand the meanings of adjectives and to know that adjectives describe noun and pronoun.

To know how the adjectives are arranged in an order when more than one adjective is used to describe a noun or pronoun in a sentence. 


### Reading Notes: 
Adjectives are the words that describe the "persons", "places", "things" etc. Adjectives or describing words talk about color, number, material, quality, quantity, size, feel etc. 

For example: 
1. Tarun is wearing a "red" shirt. (here "red" is an adjective that describes the noun "shirt" by letting us know what kind of shirt is it?)
2. They have purchased a "square" table. (here "square" is an adjective that describes the noun "table" by letting us know the shape of the table)

Read the following sentence

1. Oh "darling, good" mother, said the third.

2. Oh dear"darling", "pretty", "good, "nice" mother, said the fifth.

In these sentences words like "darling", "good", "pretty", "nice" express the qualities of a mother.

It can be noticed by looking at the above two sentences that, more number of adjectives are used to describe the qualities of a mother. 

In such cases we need to know how to arrange these adjectives in order. 

Given below is the order of adjectives: 

1. quantity/number
2. quality/opinion
3. appearance (size,shape)
4. age
5. condition
6. color
7. proper adjective (Nationality, place of origin or material)
8. function or purpose

For example : 

1. A strange, little, yellow leaf. 
Here the arrangement of the adjectives is as follows: "a" is an article, "strange" is a opinion or quality, "little" is the size, "yellow" is the color 

2. My dad is a tall, Indian Man.
Here the arrangement of the adjectives is as follows: "tall" is a size, "Indian" is a Nationality.
