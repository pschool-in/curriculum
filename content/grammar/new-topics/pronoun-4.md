# Pronoun 

## Objectives
1. To understand reflexive pronoun and its usage.
2. To be able to identify reflexive pronouns in the sentence.

### Reading Notes

The words ending in *-self*(singular) and *-selves* (plural) that are used when the subject and the object of the sentence are same are called *reflexive pronouns*. They tells us the *doer* and the *receiver* of the action is the same person. 

In simple terms reflexive pronouns tell us that someone is doing something on his/her own. 

Here in this sentence - she(doer) made herself(receiver) a cup of tea, the reflexive pronoun *herself* refers back to *she*. That means a person who does the action and recieves it are the same. 

Examples of reflexive pronouns in singular and plural forms are: 

Singular: yourself, himself, herself, itself, myself

Plural: yourselves, ourselves(we), themselves(they)

Sentence based examples of reflexive pronouns:

1. She bought *herself* a new dress.
2. They are doing the homework by *themselves*.
3. Don't hurt *yourselves* while playing.
4. Rekha cleaned her romm by *herself*.
5. He went to the market by*himself*.
