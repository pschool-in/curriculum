# Adjective

## Objective

To be able to define and identify the adjectives.

To differentiate between adjectives and nouns.

## Reading notes:

The words which describe a naming word (noun) or a pronoun are called adjectives. Adjectives usually tell us about what kind of, how many or what color etc, any person, a place, thing or animal is. Adjectives usually come before a noun and make them more specific. Adjectives also have their opposites like - "tall-short", "big-small", "black-white".

For example: 
1. My study table is "small".
2. Manish is a "smart" boy.
3. My sister has "long" hair.

The words "small", "smart", "long"  are called adjectives.
