## Conjunctions

The word that joins two or more words or sentences is called a conjunction. In simple words, conjunctions are joining words. The most common conjunctions are 'and', 'but', 'so' and 'or'.

For example:
'The bird can fly.' 'The bird can sing.'
These two sentences can be joined together with the help of conjunction. We can write it as;
'The bird can fly *and* sing.'

Some more examples are;
1. The monkey can walk *and* climb.
2. I am eating *and* watching TV.
3. Rahul tried to study *but* fell asleep.
4. I want to play *but* I need to study.
5. We can watch a movie *or* go for lunch.
6. I can complete my HW today *or* tomorrow.
7. My mother is late *so* I'm waiting for her.
8. We're going to the park in the evening, *so* I'll take a nap in the noon.
