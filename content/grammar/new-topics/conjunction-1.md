To understand that conjunctions are nothing but joining words.

# Grade-1

## Joining Words

Joining words are used to join two or more words and sentences. The two common joining words are 'and' and 'but'.

'And' is used when we are adding something to our statement. For example,
1. I like to play *and* eat.
2. I don't like spinach *and* guava.
3. I will dance *and* sing in the competition.

'But' is used to say something opposite. For example,
1. I want to play *but* I haven't done my HW.
2. I want to go to the party *but* I'm tired.
3. I like Ravi *but* I hate his brother.
