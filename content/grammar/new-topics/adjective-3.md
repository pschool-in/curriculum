### Reading Notes

Describing words are called adjectives. In general, adjectives usually give us more information about a noun or pronoun by describing it or providing more information about it. They are also called as "descriptive adjectives". They inform or tell us about how she or he looks, sounds, smells, feels or tastes.

 For example - 
a. The dog is "black". (here dog is a naming word or noun and black is the adjective i.e., it is describing how the dog looks)
b. The sweater is "fluffy". (here the sweater is a naming word and fluffy is describing how the sweater feels like)

Similarly, names of the colors are used as adjectives.

Adjectives are also used to describe the qualities of two things or people. They are called as "adjectives of quality".

Example - 

It is a "tall" building.

It was a "rainy" day.

Hyderabad is a "big" city.

Adjectives of quantity determines or describes how much of the noun is being specified in the sentence. 

Words like "much", "little", "some", "any", "whole" etc are used to describe the quantity.

For example -
1. Preethi ate the "whole" cake.
2. How "much" money do you have?

Adjectives are also used to compare the qualitites of two nouns and more than two nouns. These are known as "degrees of comparison".  

When we compare qualities of two nouns we add "-er" + "than". 
Example Hari is "taller than" Krishna.

When we compare qualities of more than three nouns we add "-est" +"the". 
Example - Hari is "the tallest" boy in the class.
