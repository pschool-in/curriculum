# Objective

To be able to understand what is subject-verb agreement.

# Grade-4

## Subject-verb agreement

We know that subject is anything that we are talking about. On the other hand, a verb is a word that describes any action.

Subject-verb agreement means that in a sentence, the subject and verb should agree with each other in terms of number. It means that if the subject is singular, then the verb used will be singular. And if the subject is plural, then the verb will also be plural. Example:
1. I like to study.

In this sentence, the subject 'I' is singular, so the verb 'like' is also singular.

2. You are my best friend.

In this sentence, the subject 'you' is singular, so the verb 'are' is also singular.

3. I sleep at 8 o'clock.

In this sentence, the subject 'I' is singular, so the verb 'sleep' is also singular.

## Exception

There is an exception in the subject-verb agreement. If the subject is a 3rd person singular, then the verb used will be plural. Similarly, if the subject is a 3rd person plural, then the verb will be singular. Some examples are:
1. He drinks milk.

In this sentence, the subject 'He' is a 3rd person singular. So the verb 'drinks' is plural.

2. She likes to play with dolls.

In this sentence, the subject 'She' is a 3rd person singular, so the verb 'likes' is plural.

3. Niyu hates coffee.

In this sentence, the subject 'Niyu' is a 3rd person singular, so the verb 'hates' is plural.

4. They like eating noodles.

In this sentence, the subject 'They' is 3rd person plural, so the verb 'like' is singular.

5. Children love to go to school.

In this sentence, the subject 'Children' is 3rd person plural, so the verb 'love' is singular.

6. The boys like playing cricket.

In this sentence, the subject 'boys' is 3rd person plural, so the verb 'like' is singular.
