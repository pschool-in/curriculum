# Article- Quantifiers 

## Objective
 To be able to understand the correct usage of articles in the text and also to understand quantifiers.
 
 ### Reading notes
 
 Articles "a", "an" and "the" are commonly used before nouns. 
 
 Articles "a/an" are called indefinite article and "the" is known as definite article.
 
 "a" is used before singular nouns beginning with consonant sounds.
 
 "an" is used before the nouns starting with sounds "a,e,i,o,u".
 
 "the" is used before the singular and plural nouns and it is used when people speak of a person, a place or a thing already mentioned, or things or persons in a situation. 
 
 Quantifiers: The words that are used before nouns to imply the quantity of a noun are called quantifiers. 
 Examples are some, any, many, much, plenty of, a lot of and a few. These can be used for both countable and uncountable nouns.
 
 Zero articles: In some situations, we do not use any articles at all, such a situation is called a "zero article".
When we are talking about something in general or when we mention a city or country, we do not use articles.

# Grade 5

## Reading Notes: Letters with dual roles/indefinite articles with quantifiers

## Use of "a/an"

It's understood that "a" is used for words beginning with consonant sound while "an" is used before the nouns beginning with vowel sounds.
But for certain words like univeristy, unicorn, European, union, etc we use the article "a" as they sound as "you" i.e. they begin with a consonant sound and not with vowel sound. 

Similarly for words like hour, honest, heir, MBA, FIR, etc article "an" is used as they begin with a vowel sound, even though they start with consonants.

## Use of "the"

 "the" is also used for things like - the sun, the moon, the sky, etc.
 
 "the" is also used for proper nouns like names of monuments, rivers, oceans, etc.
 
 "the" is also used for superlatives as the strongest, the longest, the smallest, etc.
 
 "the" is also used for number positions like the first, the fifth, the second, the third, etc.
 
 
 ## Omission of Article or No article: 
 
 We do not use articles in the following cases: 
 
 Names of the persons - 
 Mahita is my best friend (not The Mahita).
 
 Common nouns in the plural number -
 Birds live in trees (not The birds)
 Cows give milk (not The cows)
 
 Names of the days/Months-
 Saturday is a week off. (not The Saturday)
 
 Names of materials-
 We wear clothes made of cotton. ( not the cotton)
 
 ## Quantifiers: 
 We use indefinite article to certain quantifiers like - "few", "little" to show that the quantity of the thing is small, but it adds lot of value or is of great importance. When little and few are used, it is essential to consider whether the noun referred to is countable or not. The quantifier ‘a little’ (with and without the article ‘a’) is needed for small quantities with uncountable nouns. ‘A few’ (with and without the article ‘a’), on the other hand, requires countable nouns in the plural if the speaker wants to express a small number. 

For example: 
1. Mrudula was never lonely, she made " a few" good friends while she was in university. 

2. My grandfather needs "a little" help with sorting his medicines.

Similarly, indefinite article is also used for words like "few", "little" when words like "only" or "just" are used.

For example: 
1. Ramesh made "just a few" mistakes in his test.
2. There is "only a little" icecream left in the fridge.
