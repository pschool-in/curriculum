# Article 

## Objective
 To be able to understand the correct usage of articles in the text and also to understand about quantifiers.
 
 ### Reading notes
 
 Articles "a", "an" and "the" are commonly used before nouns. 
 Articles "a/an" are called as indefinite article and "the" is known as definite article.
 "a" is used before singular nouns beginning with consonant sounds.
 "an" is used before the nouns starting with sounds "a,e,i,o,u".
 "the" is used before the singular and plural nouns and it is used when people speak of a person, a place or a thing already mentioned, or things or persons in a situation. 
 "the" is also used for things like - the sun, the moon, the sky etc
 "the" is also used for proper nouns like names of monuments, rivers, oceans etc.  
 
 Qunatifiers: The words that are used before nouns to imply the quantity of a noun are called as quantifiers. 
 Examples are some, any, many, much, plenty of, a lot of and a few. These can be used for both countable and uncountable nouns.
 
 Zero articles: In some situations we do not use any articles at all, such a situation is called a "zero article".
When we are talking about something in general or when we mention a city or country, we do not use articles.
