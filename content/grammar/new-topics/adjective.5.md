### Reading Notes

Adjectives are the words that modify or describe nouns or pronouns. They are also known as modifiers as they modify the noun and tell us about what a noun is in a particular context. For example: 

1. Lotus is a "beautiful" flower. ( we can simply say, lotus is a flower, but here we are describing how it looks like)
2. Poornima is a "good" girl. 
3. I bought a pair of "colorful" shoes.

## Kinds of adjectives

Adjective of Quality: These adjectives provide information about the quality of person/s, things or places. They can describe the "age", "size", "shape", "colors", "feelings", etc.

For example: 
1. Ram is an "honest" boy.
2. Rose is a "beautiful" flower.
3. This is a "large" house.

Adjectives of Quantity: They provide information about the quantity of things or people. 

For example:
1."Many" people gathered near an accident.
2."Few" people attended the meeting.

Adjectives of Number: They describe the number of people, things or places spoken of. 
For example: 
1.  I bought "two" shirts for Diwali.
2.  I saw "three" parrots on the branch.

Interrogative adjectives: These are used before the nouns to ask questions. Words like - "which", "what", "whose", etc are called as interrogative adjectives. 

Demonstrative adjectives: Words like "this", "that", "these", "those" are used to describe a particular person or a thing. 
For example:
1. "These" mangoes are sweet.
2. "That" car is yours.

Possessive Adjectives: They tell us about to whom something or someone belongs to. 
For example: 
1. "their" room
2. "my" uncle
3. "our" farm


## Degrees of Comparison 

Degrees of Comparison are adjectives that change form and are used to compare one thing or person to another. 

Three types of Degrees of Comparison:

1. Positive Degree: When we want to describe a person or a thing but there is no comparison, we use the positive degree. 

Example - Lakshman is a "strong" man. 

2. Comparative Degree: When we want to compare two persons or things, we use a comparative degree.

 Example - Bheem is "stronger" than Lakshman.
 
 We use "more" & "than" for a comparative degree of adjectives and also "-er" is added to the positive adjective.

3. Superlative Degree: When we want to compare more than two persons or things, we use the superlative degree.

Example - Ram is the "strongest" of the three. 

We use "the" before the superlative degree of adjective and also "-est" at the end of an adjective. 


Positive:  rich, small, ugly, fast, few, bright, big, fat, hot, thin, sad, wealthy, lucky, early 

Comparative:  richer, smaller, uglier, faster, fewer, brighter, bigger, hotter, fatter, thinner, sadder, wealthier, luckier, earlier    

Superlative: Richest, smallest, ugliest, fastest, fewest, brightest, biggest, fastest, hottest, thinnest, saddest, wealthiest, luckiest, earliest
