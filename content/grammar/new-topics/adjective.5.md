### Reading Notes

Adjectives are the words that modify or describe the nouns or pronouns. They are also known as modifiers as they modify the noun and tell us about what a noun is in a particular context. For example: 

1. Lotus is a "beautiful" flower. ( we can simply say, lotus is a flower, but here we are describing how it looks like)
2. Poornima is a "good" girl. 
3. I bought a pair of "colorful" shoes.

Kinds of adjectives

Adjective of Quality: These adjectives provide information about the quality of person/s, things or places. They can describe about the "age", "size", "shape", "colors", "feelings", etc.

For example: 
1. Ram is an "honest" boy.
2. Rose is a "beautiful" flower.
3. This is a "large" house.

Adjectives of Quantity: They provide information about the quantity of things or people
For example :
1."Many" people gathered near an accident.
2."Few" people attended the meeting.

Adjectives of Number: They describe about the number of people, things or palces spoken of. 
For example: 
1.  I bought "two" shirts for Diwali.
2.  I saw "three" parrots on the branch.

Interrogative adjectives: These are used before the nouns to ask questions. Words like - "which", "what", "whose", etc are called as interrogative adjectives. 

Demonstrative adjectives: Words like "this", "that", "these", "those" are used to describe a particular person or a thing. 
For example:
1. "These" mangoes are sweet.
2. "That" car is yours.

Possessive Adjectives: They tell us about to whom something or someone belongs to. 
For example: 
1. "their" room
2. "my" uncle
3. "our" farm


Degrees of Comparison 

Degrees of Comparison are adjectives that change form and are used to compare one thing or person to another. 

Three types of Degrees of Comparison:

1. Positive Degree: When we want to describe a person or a thing but there is no comparison, we use the positive degree. 
Example - Lakshman is a "strong" man. 

2. Comparative Degree: When we want to compare two persons or things, we use comparative degree.
 Example - Bheem is "stronger" than Lakshman. We use "more" & "than" for comparative degree of adjectives and also "-er" is added to the positive adjective.

3. Superlative Degree: When we want to compare more than two persons or things, we use the superlative degree.
Example - Ram is the "strongest" of the three. We use "the" before the superlative degree of adjective and also "-est" at the end of adjective. 


Positive:  rich, small, ugly, fast, few, bright, big, fat, hot, thin, sad, wealthy, lucky, early 

Comparative:  richer, smaller, uglier, faster, fewer, brighter, bigger, hotter, fatter, thinner, sadder, wealthier, luckier, earlier    

Superlative: Richest, smallest, ugliest, fastest, fewest, brighter, biggest, fastest, hottest, thinnest, saddest, wealthiest, luckiest, earliest
