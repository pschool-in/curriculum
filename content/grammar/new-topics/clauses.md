To identify that clauses are of two types - dependent and independent clause.
To to be able to know that dependent clause in a sentence is introduced by subordinating conjunctions.


Reading Notes 

A clause is a group of words that consists of a subject and a verb. 
For example-

The play was funny.
Since the play was funny.

Types of Clauses:

Independent Clauses express a complete thought and has a subject and a verb. They can stand alone and can be used as a simple sentence. 

Examples:
I want some cereal.
Marie likes cats.
Joseph is a good soccer player.

Dependent Clauses: Has a subject and a verb, but cannot be used as a simple sentence. A dependent clause is introduced by a dependent word( subordinating conjunction). See the following list : 

After, although, as, as if, because, before, even if, even though, ever since, how, if, in order that, since, so, so that, than, that, though, unless, until, what, whatever, when, whenever, where, whereas, wherever, whether, which, whichever, while, whom, whose, why. 

Whenever a clause begins with one of the above dependent words ( except questions) it is called a dependent clause. For example if  we take an independent clause and add a dependent word like - 

We finished the game - Independent clause (IC) 
After we finished the game. _ dependent clause ( DC)
Although we finished the game. DC
Before we finish the game. DC
