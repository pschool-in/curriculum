## EXCLAMATION MARK

It is used to show strong feelings of joy, sadness, confusion, surprise, etc. This mark can be used after a word, phrase or sentence. The sentences ending with an exclamation mark are called exclamatory sentences. A few examples of such sentences are:
1. Alas! My holidays are cancelled.
2. Wow, it’s raining!
3. Oh God!
4. I hear thunder!
