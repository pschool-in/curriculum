# Grade-4

## Concrete Nouns

A concrete noun is any noun word that we can see, touch, smell, hear or feel. In other words, any noun that is not abstract is concrete. For example:
What is that *noise* ?
In this sentence, the word noise is a concrete noun because we can hear it.

Another example is;
You need *patience* to read a *book*.
In this sentence, patience is an abstract noun because it is not physically present. On the other hand, the book is a concrete noun because we can see, touch and feel it.

Some more examples of concrete nouns are:
1. *Shruti* put her *feet* on the *table*.
2. The *teacher* ran away from the *mouse*.
3. *Jeena* saw a *movie*.
