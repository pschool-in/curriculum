# Pronoun 

## Objective
To understand the interrogative pronouns and also to identify them in the text.

### Reading Notes: 

We know that pronouns are the words used to replace one or more nouns. Apart from Personal, Possessive, Demonstrative and reflexive pronouns, we have another type of pronoun called interrogative pronoun.

These are used to ask questions. The sentences with interrogative pronouns always end up with question marks. There are five different types of Interrogative pronouns:

1. What
2. Which
3. Who
4. Whom
5. Whose

Some examples of interrogative pronouns: 

1. What is your name?
2. Which is your favourite food?
3. Who did this?
4. Whom did you meet yesterday?
5. Whose bike is this?
