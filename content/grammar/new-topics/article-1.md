# Articles

## Objectives
1. To understand that A is used for consonants and An is used for vowels - a,e,i,o,u

### Reading Notes

The words that help define the naming words (nouns) as specific and non-specific are called as *articles*. The choice between *a* and *an*  is determined by sound. These are called as *indefinite articles* because it leaves the person or the thing spoken of unclear. For example *a* doctor, that means *any* doctor  

*an* is used before the naming words that begin with a,e,i,o,u which are called as vowels. 

For example:
1. *an* animal
2. *an* umbrella
3. *an* owl
4. *an* eagle
5. *an* ice-cream

*a* is used before the naming word that begins with consonants or the other remaining letters.

For example:
1. *a* tree
2. *a* bird
3. *a* cup
4. *a* pen
5. *a* dog
