## Adverb of Manners

We know that adverbs tell us about the verb, adjective or another adverb. Adverb of manner tells us how an action is done. In simple words, it answers the question 'how'. These adverbs generally end with '-ly'. Some examples are:
1. The turtle moves *slowly*.
2. The dog runs *quickly*.
3. The girl walked *smartly*.

We can also convert some adjectives into adverbs by simply adding '-ly' in the end. For example;
1. safe- *safely*
2. gentle- *gently*
3. possible- *possibly*
4. correct- *correctly*
5. sad- *sadly*
6. angry- *angrily*
7. happy- *happily*

Some more examples of adverb of manners are:
1. Richa completed her homework *independently*.
2. The old lady feeds *kindly* to the street animals.
3. The teacher *clearly* explained the topic.
