# Verb (Doing words or Action words) 

## Learning Objective
To be able to understand what is a doing word or action word.

To be able to identify the action words in the sentence.

## Reading Notes: 

The word that denotes an action is called verb. It is also known as action or doing word. It is used after a naming word or a pronoun. 
Action words tell us about what a person, an animal or thing is doing. 

For example: 

1. I "play" cricket. ( here play is the action word)
2. Priya "sings" well. (here sings is the action word)
3. Rajeev "eats". (here eats is the action word)
4. My sister "dances" well. (here dances is the action word)

Sometimes action words also end in "-ing" describing what a person or a thing is doing.

For example: 

1. He is "walking".
2. She is "singing".
3. Mannu is "playing".
