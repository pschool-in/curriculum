Concrete Nouns

A concrete noun is any noun word that we can see, touch, smell, hear or feel. In other words, any noun that is not abstract is concrete. For example:
What is that *noise* ?
In this sentence, the word noise is a concrete noun because we can hear it.

Another example is;
You need the *patience* to read a *book*.
In this sentence, patience is an abstract noun because it is not physically present. On the other hand, the book is a concrete noun because we can see, touch and feel it.

Some more examples of concrete nouns are:
1. *Shruti* put her *feet* on the *table*.
2. The *teacher* ran away from the *mouse*.
3. *Jeena* saw a *movie*.

Gender Nouns

It helps us to identify the gender of the naming word. There are four types of gender nouns:

1. Masculine:
The names of all male people or animals are called masculine gender nouns. For example, man, lion, hero, uncle, etc.

2. Feminine:
The names of all female people or animals are called feminine gender nouns. For example, lady, lioness, heroine, aunt, etc.

3. Neuter:
All non-living things cannot be referred to as males or females. So, all naming words that are non-living are called neuter gender nouns. For example, book, pen, chair, table, etc.

4. Common:
The naming words that be used for both males and females are called common gender nouns. For example, child, parent, student, etc.
