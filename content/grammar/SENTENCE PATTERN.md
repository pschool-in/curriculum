# SENTENCE PATTERN 
There are many ways to construct a sentence. An arrangement of words in a sentence is called sentence pattern. 
This arrangement needs to be in a grammatically correct structure. It means the placement of verbs and nouns should be correct to form a meaningful sentence.

There are five important components in a sentence.
Subject (S)
Verb (V)
Object (O)
Complement (C)
Adverbial (A)

## SUBJECT (S)
Subject (S) consists of nouns or pronouns. It occurs before a verb. To get ‘S’ ask the question ‘Who?’ before the verb.

### e.g.
```
Rani dance well (Rani Subject)
The child broke the glass (The child-Subject)
```
## VERB (V)
Verb (V) consists of auxiliaries or finite verbs. In every sentence the most important word is the verb. A verb shows an
action or activity or work done.
### e.g.
```
He is a doctor (“Be” form verb)
Jems wrote a letter (Main verb)
The baby is crying (auxiliary verb + Main verb)
```
## OBJECT (O)
Object (O) - consists of nouns or noun phrases or noun clauses. Objects are of 2 types namely Direct object (DO) and Indirect object (IO).
To get the object ‘O’ ask the question ‘What (for things which indicates Direct object: DO)’ or ‘Whom (for persons which indicates indirect object: IO)’.
### e.g.
```
He bought a pen (a pen = Object)
He handles the computer (computer = Object)
I saw him (him = Object)
I gave Rosy a pen (What= Direct object; Whom=Indirect object)
```
## COMPLEMENT (C)
Complement (C) - from the word ‘complete’. The words required to complete the meaning of a sentence are called Complement. It completes the meaning in the
sentence. Without Complement the meaning of a sentence may be incomplete or the meaning may vary.
### e.g. (S V C)
```
He is a dentist
She became a journalist
It grew dark
```

## Adjunct or Adverbial (A)
To get ‘A’ ask the question why, when, where or how.
### e.g. (S V A)
```
She Comes every day(when)
They ate Junk food (how)
Raju Sits here(where)
```
