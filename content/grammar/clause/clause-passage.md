# Clause

## Reading Notes 

A clause is a group of words that consists of a subject and a verb. A clause may form part of a sentence or it may be a complete sentence in itself. For example:

1. I see you.
2. She ran away.
3. They sang beautifully
4. Ram won a bicycle race.

## Types of Clauses
There are two types of clauses  
1. Independent Clause 
2. Dependent Clause

"Independent Clause" expresses a complete thought and can be used as a sentence. 

Examples:
1. I want some cereal.
2. Meena likes cats.
3. Karan is a good football player.

"Dependent Clause" doesn't express a complete thought and cannot be used as a sentence. A dependent clause is introduced by a dependent word. Below is the list of dependent words:

After, although, as, as if, because, before, even if, even though, ever since, how, if 

in order, that, since, so, so that, than, that, though, unless, until, what, whatever, when 

whenever, where, whereas, wherever, whether, which, whichever, while, whom, whose, why 

Whenever a clause begins with one of the above dependent words it is called a dependent clause. 

For example:
1. After we finished the game
2. Although we finished the game. 
3. Before we finish the game.
