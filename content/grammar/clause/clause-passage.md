# Clause

## Reading Notes 

A clause is a group of words that consists of a subject and a verb. 
For example- In the following sentences, the groups of words that are in italics are clauses.

1. People *who pay their debts* are trusted.
2. We cannot start *while it is raining*.
3. I think that *you have made a mistake*. 

## Types of Clauses
There are two types of clauses  
1. Independent Clause 
2. Dependent Clause

*Independent Clauses* express a complete thought and has a subject and a verb. They can stand alone and can be used as a simple sentences. 

Examples:
I want some cereal.
Marie likes cats.
Joseph is a good football player.

*Dependent Clauses* has a subject and a verb, but cannot be used as a simple sentence. A dependent clause is introduced by a dependent word (subordinating conjunction).
See the following list : 

After, although, as, as if, because, before 

even if, even though, ever since, how, if 

in order that, since, so, so that, than, that 

though, unless, until, what, whatever, when 

whenever, where, whereas, wherever, whether

which, whichever, while, whom, whose, why 

Whenever a clause begins with one of the above dependent words (except questions) it is called a dependent clause. 
For example if we take an independent clause and add a dependent word like - 

We finished the game - Independent clause (IC) 
After we finished the game- dependent clause ( DC)
Although we finished the game. (DC)
Before we finish the game. (DC)
