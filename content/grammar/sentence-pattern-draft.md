# Sentence Pattern

There are many ways to construct a sentence. An arrangement of words in a
sentence is called sentence pattern. This arrangement needs to be in a
grammatically correct structure. It means the placement of verbs and nouns
should be correct to form a meaningful sentence.

There are five important components in a sentence.

```
Subject (S)
Verb (V)
Object (O)
Complement (C)
Adverbial (A)
```

## Subject (S)

It consists of nouns or pronouns. It occurs before a verb. To get ‘S’ ask the
question ‘Who?’ before the verb.

```
eg:
Rani dance well. (Rani - Subject)
The child broke the glass. (The child - Subject)
```

## Verb (V)

It consists of auxiliaries or finite verbs. In every sentence the most important
word is the verb. A verb shows an action or activity or work done.

```
eg:
He is a doctor. (“Be” form verb)
James wrote a letter. (Main verb)
The baby is crying. (auxiliary verb + Main verb)
```

## Object (O)

Object (O) - consists of nouns or noun phrases or noun clauses. Objects are of 2
types namely Direct object (DO) and Indirect object (IO). To get the object ‘O’
ask the question ‘What (for things which indicates Direct object: DO)’ or ‘Whom
(for persons which indicates Indirect object: IO)’.

```
eg:
He bought a pen (a pen = Object)
He handles the computer class. (computer = Object)
I saw him (him = Object)
I gave Rosy a pen (What= Direct object; Whom=Indirect object)
```

## Complement (C)

Complement (C) - from the word ‘complete’. The word required to complete the
meaning of a sentence are called Complement. It completes the meaning in the
sentence. Without Complement the meaning of a sentence may be incomplete or the
meaning may vary.

```
eg:
He is a dentist.
She became a journalist.
The sky grew dark.
```

## Adjunct or Adverbial (A)

To get ‘A’ ask the question why, when, where or how.

```
eg:
She comes every day.(when)
They ate Junk food. (how)
Raju sits here. (where)
```
