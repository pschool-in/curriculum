One day *a (an, the)* hunter trapped *the (an, a)* lion. *The (a, an)* poor lion roared for help.

One hot day, *a (an, the)* thirsty crow flew all over the fields looking for water. For a long time, he could not find any. He felt very weak, almost lost all hope. Suddenly, he saw *a (an, the)* water jug below *the (a, an)* tree. He flew straight down to see if there was any water inside. Yay! he could see some water inside the jug! *The (a, an)* crow tried to push his head into the jug. Sadly, he found that *the (a, an)* neck of the jug was too narrow. Then he tried to push *the (a, an)* jug to tilt for the water to flow out, but the jug was too heavy.
*The (a, an)* crow thought hard for a while. Then, looking around it, he saw some pebbles. He suddenly had *a (an, the)* good idea.
He started picking up *the (a, an)* pebbles one by one, dropping each into the jug. As more and more pebbles filled *the (a, an)* jug, the water level kept rising. Soon it was high enough for *the (a, an)* crow to drink. His plan had worked!
