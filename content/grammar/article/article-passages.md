# Articles - Introduction

**a**, **an** and **the** are known as articles. They are used in front on
naming words (nouns).

**an** is used with the word that begins with a vowel sound. We already know
that **a**, **e**, **i**, **o** and **u** are called vowels. The remaining 21
letters are called consonants.

an apple, an animal, an egg, an eagle, an ice-cream, an owl, an umbrella

**a** is used with the word that begins with a consonant sound.

a bag, a bird, a cat, a cup, a dog, a pen, a tree

Though the below words begin with **u**, the beginning sound is **you**. So it
is not considered as a vowel sound.

a universe, a uniform

Though the below words begin with **h**, the first letter is silent. So the
initial sound of the word is a vowel.

an hour, an honest

**a** and **an** are used to refer any one of the things. But **the** is used to
refer to a specific thing.

I went to a doctor. The doctor was very kind.

In the first sentence we use **a** before the word **doctor** because she is one
of the many doctor. But in the second sentence we use **the** because we are
speaking about a particular doctor whom we visited.

# Definite and Indefinite Article

Articles are of two types – the definite article (the) and the indefinite
article (a/an).

## Indefinite articles:

The indefinite articles "a/an" are generally used to mention some person or
thing. These articles do not specify a particular person or a thing. "A" and
"An" are used to introduce noun or naming words and are also used to mention
singular countable nouns.

"a" is used before singular nouns beginning with consonant sounds.

"an" is used before singular nouns beginning with vowel sounds.

## Definite article:

We use definite article "the" when we are talking about a specific person or a
thing.

"the" is used for countable and uncountable nouns/singular and plural nouns.

# No Article Rules

To talk about things in general.

```
Fried foods are unhealthy.
Boys are usually fond of outdoor games.
```

No article is used before plural and uncountable nouns.

cars, people, life, water

No article is used before abstract nouns.

education, happiness, music

No article is used before single countable nouns.

**People**: Mary, Ashok

**Places**: Jupiter, Russia, Oxford street

**Language**: English, Hindi

**Subjects**: History, Law, Science

**Days, months**: Monday, November

**Games**: football, chess

# Article - Quantifiers

Objective
To be able to understand the correct usage of articles in the text and also to understand quantifiers.

Reading notes
Articles "a", "an" and "the" are commonly used before nouns.

Articles "a/an" are called indefinite article and "the" is known as definite article.

"a" is used before singular nouns beginning with consonant sounds.

"an" is used before the nouns starting with sounds "a,e,i,o,u".

"the" is used before the singular and plural nouns and it is used when people speak of a person, a place or a thing already mentioned, or things or persons in a situation.

Quantifiers: The words that are used before nouns to imply the quantity of a noun are called quantifiers. Examples are some, any, many, much, plenty of, a lot of and a few. These can be used for both countable and uncountable nouns.

Zero articles: In some situations, we do not use any articles at all, such a situation is called a "zero article". When we are talking about something in general or when we mention a city or country, we do not use articles.


# Grade 5

## Reading Notes: Letters with dual roles/indefinite articles with quantifiers

Use of "a/an"
It's understood that "a" is used for words beginning with consonant sound while "an" is used before the nouns beginning with vowel sounds. But for certain words like univeristy, unicorn, European, union, etc we use the article "a" as they sound as "you" i.e. they begin with a consonant sound and not with vowel sound.

Similarly for words like hour, honest, heir, MBA, FIR, etc article "an" is used as they begin with a vowel sound, even though they start with consonants.

Use of "the"
"the" is also used for things like - the sun, the moon, the sky, etc.

"the" is also used for proper nouns like names of monuments, rivers, oceans, etc.

"the" is also used for superlatives as the strongest, the longest, the smallest, etc.

"the" is also used for number positions like the first, the fifth, the second, the third, etc.

# Omission of Article or No article:
We do not use articles in the following cases:

Names of the persons - Mahita is my best friend (not The Mahita).

Common nouns in the plural number - Birds live in trees (not The birds) Cows give milk (not The cows)

Names of the days/Months- Saturday is a week off. (not The Saturday)

Names of materials- We wear clothes made of cotton. ( not the cotton)

# Quantifiers:
We use indefinite article to certain quantifiers like - "few", "little" to show that the quantity of the thing is small, but it adds lot of value or is of great importance. When little and few are used, it is essential to consider whether the noun referred to is countable or not. The quantifier ‘a little’ (with and without the article ‘a’) is needed for small quantities with uncountable nouns. ‘A few’ (with and without the article ‘a’), on the other hand, requires countable nouns in the plural if the speaker wants to express a small number.

For example:

Mrudula was never lonely, she made " a few" good friends while she was in university.

My grandfather needs "a little" help with sorting his medicines.

Similarly, indefinite article is also used for words like "few", "little" when words like "only" or "just" are used.

For example:

Ramesh made "just a few" mistakes in his test.
There is "only a little" icecream left in the fridge.



# Draft: 

## What are articles

Articles - "a", "an" and "the" come before nouns. Articles of are of two types – "a/an" and "the". 
The article "a" or "an" is called the indefinite article because it doesn’t specify which person or thing is spoken about.

For example:
a doctor means any doctor.
A child means any child.

The article "the" is called the definite article because it specifies a particular person or thing.
For example:

My father is going to meet the principal. (Which principal? It could be your school principal.)
My father is going to meet a principal.(Which principal? It could be any principal. Here the speaker does not have a particular principal in mind.)

The indefinite article (a/an) is used before singular, countable nouns. It cannot be used before plural nouns.
Generally, we say "an" apple or "a" tree, but not an apples or a trees.

The definite article (the) is  used before singular, countable nouns, plural countable nouns and uncountable nouns.
Generally, we say "the" book or "the" books, "the" rice or "the" milk.

# A or an: 
Whether to use between "a" and "an" is determined by sound of the noun and not spelling. 

"A" is used before words that start with a consonant sound. 
Examples are: a boy, a tree, a ball, a flower, a horse, a hole, a European and a university.

"An" is used before words that begin with a vowel sound. 
Examples are: an elephant, an egg, an orange, an umbrella, an hour, an heir etc.

# Note-2

Articles are words that define a noun as specific or unspecific. 

Read the following examples:

After "the" long day, "the" cup of tea tasted particularly good.

By using the article 'the", it's shown that it was one specific day that was long and one specific cup of tea that tasted good. 
Second example:

After "a" long day, "a" cup of tea tastes particularly good.

By using the article "a", a general statement is being created, implying that any cup of tea would taste good after any long day.

# English has two types of articles: definite and indefinite.

## The Definite Article
"The" is the definite article. It relates a noun to one particular thing. 

Below are some examples of the definite article the used in context:

Please give me "the" hammer.
Please give me "the"  red hammer; "the"  blue one is too small.
Please give me "the"  nail.
Please give me "the"  large nail; it’s "the"  only one strong enough to hold this painting.
Please give me "the"  hammer and "the"  nail.


# The Indefinite Article

The indefinite article takes two forms. The word "a" precedes a word that begins with a consonant.
while the word "an" precedes a word that begins with a vowel. The indefinite article shows or tells us that a noun refers to a general idea rather than a particular thing. 

Read the below examples of indefinite articles:

Please give me "a" paper. (any paper will do.)
I bought "an" umbrella. (any umbrella will do.)

# Exceptions: Choosing A or An

There are a few exceptions to the general rule of using "a" and "an" in front of consonants and vowels.
For example: 
The first letter of the word "honor" is a consonant, but it’s unpronounced. In spite of its spelling, the word honor begins with a vowel sound. Therefore, we use "an". 
Look into the below example :

Wrong usgae: My brother is a honest woman.
Correct usage: My brother is an honest woman.

Similarly, when the first letter of a word is a vowel but is pronounced with a consonant sound, we use "a", as in the sentence below:

Wrong usgae: She is an University topper.
Correct usage: She is a University topper.

# definite Articles with Uncountable Nouns

Uncountable nouns are nouns that are either difficult or impossible to count. Uncountable nouns include intangible things (e.g., information, air), liquids (e.g., milk, wine), and things that are too large or numerous to count (e.g., equipment, sand, wood). 
Because these things can’t be counted, you should never use a or an with them—remember, the indefinite article is only for singular nouns.

Uncountable nouns can be modified by words like some, however. Consider the following examples below:

Wrong usage: Please give me "a" coffee. (Water is an uncountable noun and should not be used with the indefinite article.)

Correct usage: Please give me "some" water. (However, if water is described in terms of countable units (like bottles), then indefinite article can be used). For example look at the belwo sentences:

1. Please give me "a" bottle of water.
2. Please give me "an" ice.
3. Please give me "an" ice cube.
4. Please give me "some" ice .
Note that depending on the context, some nouns can be countable or uncountable (e.g., hair, noise, time):

We need "a" light in this room.
We need "some" light in this room.

# Omission of Articles

Occasionally, articles are omitted altogether before certain nouns. In these cases, the article is implied but not actually present. This implied article is sometimes called a “zero article.” 
Often, the article is omitted before nouns that refer to abstract ideas.
Look at the following examples:

Incorrect: Let’s go out for a dinner tonight.
Correct: Let’s go out for dinner tonight.

Incorrect: The creativity is a valuable quality in children.
Correct: Creativity is a valuable quality in children.

Many languages and nationalities donot use article. for example

Incorrect: I studied the Spanish during gradutaion for four years.
Correct: I studied Spanish during gradutaion for four years.

Similarly, articles are not used for "Sports" and "academic subjects". For example: 

Incorrect: I like to play "the baseball".
Correct: I like to play baseball.

Incorrect: My sister was always good at "the Science".
Correct: My sister was always good at science.
