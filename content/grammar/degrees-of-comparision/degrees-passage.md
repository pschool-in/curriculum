## Degrees of Comparison

We use this to compare something.

An elephant is bigger than a tiger.

The above sentence has a 'comparative' degree. We directly compare one thing
with another.

Note: Usually the 'comparative' adjective is followed by the word 'than'.

Sometimes we compare something with the rest of the group. It is called
'superlative' degree.

Note: Definite article (the) is used before the 'superlative' adjective.

The elephant is the biggest land animal.

Sometimes we simply tell something, without really comparing it with anything.
It is called a 'positive' degree.

The elephant is a big animal.

Some of the commonly used positive, comparative and superlative adjectives are
given below.

```
big, bigger, biggest
large, larger, largest
tall, taller, tallest

## Degrees of Comparison (Prepared by Riya)

There are three types of degrees of comparison:

1. Positive

"The toy plane is _big_."

This sentence talks about the toy plane. Here, the toy plane is not compared to
anything else. Therefore, _big_ is a positive degree of comparison.

2. Comparative

"The doll is _bigger_ than the plane."

In this sentence, the doll is compared to a plane. Therefore, _faster_ is the
comparative degree of comparison.

3. Superlative

"The teddy bear is the _biggest_ of all."

In this sentence, the teddy bear, doll and toy plane are compared with each
other. Teddy bear is superior to all. Therefore, _biggest_ is the superlative
degree of comparison.

## Degrees of Comparison (Prepared by Kalpana)

Degrees of Comparison are adjectives that change form and are used to compare
one thing or person to another.

Three types of Degrees of Comparison:

1. Positive Degree: When we want to describe a person or a thing but there is no
   comparison, we use the positive degree.

Example - Lakshman is a "strong" man.

2. Comparative Degree: When we want to compare two persons or things, we use a
   comparative degree.

Example - Bheem is "stronger" than Lakshman.

We use "more" & "than" for a comparative degree of adjectives and also "-er" is
added to the positive adjective.

3. Superlative Degree: When we want to compare more than two persons or things,
   we use the superlative degree.

Example - Ram is the "strongest" of the three.

We use "the" before the superlative degree of adjective and also "-est" at the
end of an adjective.

Positive: rich, small, ugly, fast, few, bright, big, fat, hot, thin, sad,
wealthy, lucky, early

Comparative: richer, smaller, uglier, faster, fewer, brighter, bigger, hotter,
fatter, thinner, sadder, wealthier, luckier, earlier

Superlative: Richest, smallest, ugliest, fastest, fewest, brightest, biggest,
fastest, hottest, thinnest, saddest, wealthiest, luckiest, earliest
