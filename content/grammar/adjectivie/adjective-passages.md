## Reading notes:

The words which describe a naming word (noun) or a pronoun are called
adjectives. Adjectives usually tell us about what kind of, how many or what
color etc, any person, a place, thing or animal is. Adjectives usually come
before a noun and make them more specific. Adjectives also have their opposites
like - "tall-short", "big-small", "black-white".

For example:

1. My study table is "small".
2. Manish is a "smart" boy.
3. My sister has "long" hair.

The words "small", "smart", "long" are called adjectives.

### Reading Notes

(adjective-3)

The words that are used to describe a noun or a pronoun are called as
adjectives. They give us more information about a noun or pronoun by describing
it. They inform or tell us about how she or he looks, sounds, smells, feels or
tastes. Names of the colors are also used as adjectives.

For example -

a. The dog is "black". (here dog is a noun and black is the adjective i.e., it
is describing how the dog looks)

b. The sweater is "fluffy". (here the sweater is a noun and fluffy describes how
the sweater feels like)

Adjectives are used to describe the qualities of things or people. They are
called "adjectives of quality".

Example -

It is a "tall" building.

It was a "rainy" day.

Hyderabad is a "big" city.

Adjectives are used to determine or describe the quantity of the noun. Words
like "much", "little", "some", "any", "whole" etc are used to describe the
quantity of the noun.

For example -

1. Preethi ate the "whole" cake.
2. How "much" money do you have?

Adjectives are used to compare the qualities of two nouns and more than two
nouns. These are known as "degrees of comparison".

When we compare qualities of two nouns we add "-er" + "than".

Example- Hari is "taller than" Krishna.

When we compare qualities of more than three nouns we add "-est" +"the".

Example - Hari is "the tallest" boy in the class.

# Reading Notes:

(adjective-4)

Adjectives are the words that describe the "persons", "places", "things" etc.
Adjectives or describing words talk about color, number, material, quality,
quantity, size, feel, etc.

For example:

1. Tarun is wearing a "red" shirt. (here "red" is an adjective that describes
   the noun "shirt" by letting us know what kind of shirt it is?)
2. They have purchased a "square" table. (here "square" is an adjective that
   describes the noun "table" by letting us know the shape of the table)

Read the following sentence

1. Oh "darling, good" mother, said the third.

2. Oh dear"darling", "pretty", "good, "nice" mother, said the fifth.

In these sentences, words like "darling", "good", "pretty", "nice" express the
qualities of a mother.

It can be noticed by looking at the above two sentences that, more adjectives
are used to describe the qualities of a mother.

In such cases, we need to know how to arrange these adjectives in order.

Given below is the order of adjectives:

1. number
2. opinion
3. appearance (size, shape)
4. age
5. condition
6. color
7. pattern (checkered, stripped)
8. proper adjective (Nationality, place of origin or material)
9. function or purpose
10. Noun

For example :

1. A strange, little, yellow leaf. Here the arrangement of the adjectives is as
   follows: "a" is an article, "strange" is an opinion or quality, "little" is
   the size, "yellow" is the color

2. My dad is a tall, Indian man. Here the arrangement of the adjectives is as
   follows: "tall" is a size, "Indian" is a Nationality.

### Reading Notes

(adjective-5)

Adjectives are the words that modify or describe nouns or pronouns. They are
also known as modifiers as they modify the noun and tell us about what a noun is
in a particular context. For example:

1. Lotus is a "beautiful" flower. ( we can simply say, lotus is a flower, but
   here we are describing how it looks like)
2. Poornima is a "good" girl.
3. I bought a pair of "colorful" shoes.

## Kinds of adjectives

Adjective of Quality: These adjectives provide information about the quality of
person/s, things or places. They can describe the "age", "size", "shape",
"colors", "feelings", etc.

For example:

1. Ram is an "honest" boy.
2. Rose is a "beautiful" flower.
3. This is a "large" house.

Adjectives of Quantity: They provide information about the quantity of things or
people.

Interrogative adjectives: These are used before the nouns to ask questions.
Words like - "which", "what", "whose", etc are called as interrogative
adjectives.

Demonstrative adjectives: Words like "this", "that", "these", "those" are used
to describe a particular person or a thing. For example:

1. "These" mangoes are sweet.

2. "That" car is yours.

Possessive Adjectives: They tell us about to whom something or someone belongs
to. For example:

1. "their" room

## Degrees of Comparison

Degrees of Comparison are adjectives that change form and are used to compare
one thing or person to another.

Three types of Degrees of Comparison:

1. Positive Degree: When we want to describe a person or a thing but there is no
   comparison, we use the positive degree.

Example - Lakshman is a "strong" man.

2. Comparative Degree: When we want to compare two persons or things, we use a
   comparative degree.

Example - Bheem is "stronger" than Lakshman.

We use "more" & "than" for a comparative degree of adjectives and also "-er" is
added to the positive adjective.

3. Superlative Degree: When we want to compare more than two persons or things,
   we use the superlative degree.

Example - Ram is the "strongest" of the three.

We use "the" before the superlative degree of adjective and also "-est" at the
end of an adjective.

Positive: rich, small, ugly, fast, few, bright, big, fat, hot, thin, sad,
wealthy, lucky, early

Comparative: richer, smaller, uglier, faster, fewer, brighter, bigger, hotter,
fatter, thinner, sadder, wealthier, luckier, earlier

Superlative: Richest, smallest, ugliest, fastest, fewest, brightest, biggest,
fastest, hottest, thinnest, saddest, wealthiest, luckiest, earliest

## Degrees of Comparison (old exisiting passage)

We use this to compare something.

Elephant is bigger than tiger.

The above sentence has 'comparative' degree. We directly compare one thing with
another.

Note: Usually the 'comparative' adjective is followed by the word 'than'.

Sometimes we compare something with the rest of the group. It is called
'superlative' degree.

Note: Definite article (the) is used before the 'superlative' adjective.

Elephant is the biggest land animal.

Sometimes we simply tell something, without really comparing with anything. It
is called 'positive' degree.

Elephant is a big animal.

Some of the commonly used positive, comparative and superlative adjectives are
given below.

```
big, bigger, biggest
large, larger, largest
tall, taller, tallest
old, older, oldest
small, smaller, smallest
brave, braver, bravest
fast, faster, fastest
busy, busier, busiest
heavy, heavier, heaviest
```

## Degrees of Comparison (Prepared by Riya)

There are three types of degrees of comparision:

1. Positive

"The toy plane is _big_."

This sentence talks about the toy plane. Here, the toy plane is not compared to
anything else. Therefore, _big_ is a positive degree of comparison.

2. Comparative

"The doll is _bigger_ than the plane."

In this sentence, the doll is compared to a plane. Therefore, _faster_ is the
comparative degree of comparison.

3. Superlative

"The teddy bear is the _biggest_ of all."

In this sentence, the teddy bear, doll and toy plane are compared with each
other. Teddy bear is superior to all. Therefore, _biggest_ is the superlative
degree of comparison.
