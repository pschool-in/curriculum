# Sentence Pattern

## Notes

We use words to construct sentences. All meaningful sentences have a pattern. It
is mainly made up of five components.

```
Subject (S)
Verb (V)
Object (O)
Complement (C)
Adverbial (A)
```

The most simple sentence has a subject and verb (S+V) component.

```
Baby is crying.
Dogs bark.
```

A complement (C) is used to complete a sentence. Check the highlighted words in
the below examples.

```
John is *tall*.
Ram is *a pilot*.
```

An object (O) is the receiver of an action.

```
I read *newspaper*.
Sarah ate *cake*.
```

In some sentences, there can be two objects: Direct (DO) and Indirect (IO).

```
They sent me a gift.
me - IO, gift - DO

Can you tell our friends the story.
friends - IO, story - DO

```

An adverbial (A) component gives more meaning to the verb (V) component.

```
He was *at school*.
She got *into the car*.

```
