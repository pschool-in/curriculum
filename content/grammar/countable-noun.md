# Countable Noun

## Notes - Countable vs Uncountable Noun

Nouns can be countable or uncountable.

Countable nouns are easy to recognize. 
They are the things we can count. For eg, pencils. We can count pencils. 
We can have one, two, three or more pencils.

eg: pen, house, dog

Uncountable nouns are substances, concepts etc that we cannot divide into separate elements. 
We cannot 'count' them. For example, we cannot count 'water'. We can count 'bottles of water' or 'litres of water', but we cannot count water itself.

Uncountable nouns cannot be counted.

eg: water, air, sand

### Plural nouns

Plural nouns are used to represent more than one item. Most plural nouns are formed by adding an 's' to the singular nouns.

eg: dogs, cats,  trees

If the singular noun ends with -s, -ss, -sh, -ch, -x or -z, then add '-es' to make it plural.

buses, glasses, dresses,dishes, branches, taxes

If the noun ends with ‑f or ‑fe, the f is often changed to ‑ve before adding the -s to form the plural version.

eg: wife – wives, wolf – wolves

### Exceptions

roofs, beliefs, chefs, chiefs
