## Indefinite Pronouns

Indefinite pronouns are used in a general way. They do not refer to any
particular person, quantity, or thing. These are used in a general way, without
clarifying exactly 'who'. Example: anything, everybody, someone, nobody,
nothing, few, several, etc.

Examples of indefinite pronouns in sentences are:

1. Can I have _another_ piece of cake?
2. I can have _either_ book.
3. They bought _everything_ they wanted.
4. We have _less_ than we paid for.
5. I do not know _anything_ about the music.
6. _Somebody_ has stolen my watch.

Indefinite pronouns are both singular and plural. In addition, some pronouns are
singular in some contexts and plural in other contexts. Singular indefinite
pronouns are used with singular verbs and plural indefinite pronouns are used
with plural verbs.

Singular indefinite pronouns: Another, Anybody, Anyone, Anything, Each, Either,
Enough, Everybody, Everyone, Everything, Less, Little, Much, Neither, Nobody,
No-one, Nothing, One, Other, Somebody, Someone, Something.

Sample sentences:

1. We have _enough_ homework for the holiday.
2. We know _little_ about this subject.
3. There is _something_ moving in the bushes.

Plural indefinite pronouns: Both, Few, Fewer, Many, Others, Several.

Sample sentences:

1. I think _both_ gifts are great.
2. I'm sure _others_ attend him respectfully.
3. _Few_ people have seen her dance before.

Indefinite pronouns that can be used as both singular and plural: All, Any,
More, Most, None, Some, Such.

Sample sentences:

1. _All_ is forgiven. _All_ are waiting for him.
2. There is _some_. _Some_ have started.
3. Is _any_ left? Are there _any_ waiting?

## Relative Pronouns

Relative pronouns are used to refer to the nouns mentioned previously, modify
them, or add something to them. These pronouns can also be used to join
sentences. Example: who, whose, whom, which, that, what, when, where, whoever,
whichever, whomever.

Sample sentences:

1. I do not like people _who_ tease others.
2. She said she completed her homework, _which_ was a lie.
3. _Whoever_ wants to come, is welcome.
4. The cake _that_ you gave me was very tasty.
5. Animals know the people by _whom_ they are treated well.
6. Take _whichever_ you want.
7. This is the place _where_ we met.

The relative pronoun can be confused with the interrogative pronoun. The difference between them is that the relative pronoun is used to connect the phrases to the noun or pronoun. On the other hand, interrogative pronouns are used to ask questions.

Example:
A woman _who_ lost her purse is at the police station.
In this sentence, 'who' is a relative pronoun.

_Who_ are you?
In this sentence, "who" is an interrogative pronoun.

## Distributive Pronouns

Pronouns that refer to one person or thing at a time are called distributive pronouns.

Examples: each, either, everyone, any, none, neither, etc.

Distributive pronouns are always singular and are followed by singular verbs.

Examples of distributive pronouns in sentences are:
1. I may buy _either_ of these gifts.
2. _Each_ of you will be awarded.
3. You can't have _any_ of these.
4. _Neither_ of them is wrong.
5. I like _everyone_ in this room.
