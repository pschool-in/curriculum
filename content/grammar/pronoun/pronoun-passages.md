# Personal Pronouns

(pronoun-1)

A personal pronoun is a word that takes place of naming words. Personal pronouns are I, you, he, she, it, we, they, me, him, her, us, and them.

For example: 

_Rahul_ is a good boy.

'Rahul' is a noun in this sentence. So, it can be replaced with the personal pronoun 'he'. So this sentence can also be written as, 

_He_ is a good boy.

# Reading notes

(pronoun-2)

The words that are used to take the place of naming words (noun) or noun phrases are called pronouns.

For example, He, she, it, we, you, me, him, they, them, his, her, etc.

## Personal Pronouns:

The pronouns that refer to people, places, things directly are called personal pronouns. Personal pronouns can be divided into two categories;

1.  Subject pronoun - I, we, you, she, he, it, they
2.  Object pronoun - me, us, you, her, him, it, them

A personal pronoun describes a person or a thing in the following ways:

1. The pronouns _I_, _we_, _me_, denotes the 1st person that means the person who speaks.
2. The pronoun _you_ refers to the 2nd person, which means the person who is spoken to.
3. The pronoun _he_, _she_, _they_, _it_ refers to 3rd person, which means a person or a thing which is spoken about.

Examples of personal pronouns:

1. _She_ is very beautiful.
2. _It_ is very cold today.
3. _They_ are going to the park.
4. _We_ wanted some grapes.
5. Reena gave _me_ a letter.

# Possessive Pronouns

(pronoun-3)

A pronoun that is used to indicate ownership or possession is called a possessive pronoun. In other words, a possessive pronoun represents a noun and tells us who owns it. For example his, yours, hers, mine, ours, theirs, etc.

Examples in sentences:

1. That is _his_ car.
2. This notebook is _mine_.
3. The car is _hers_.
4. That book is _yours_.
5. This cat is _ours_.

# Reflexive Pronoun

(pronoun-4)

The words ending in _-self_(singular) and _-selves_ (plural) that are used when the subject and the object of the sentence are the same are called _reflexive pronouns_. They tell us the _doer_ and the _receiver_ of the action are the same person.

In simple terms, reflexive pronouns tell us that someone is doing something on his/her own.

Here in this sentence - she(doer) made herself(receiver) a cup of tea, the reflexive pronoun _herself_ refers back to _she_. That means a person who does the action and receives it is the same.

Examples of reflexive pronouns in singular and plural forms are:

Singular: yourself, himself, herself, itself, myself

Plural: yourselves, ourselves(we), themselves(they)

Sentence based examples of reflexive pronouns:

1. She bought _herself_ a new dress.
2. They are doing the homework by _themselves_.
3. Don't hurt _yourselves_ while playing.
4. Rekha cleaned her room by _herself_.
5. He went to the market by _himself_.

# Emphatic Pronouns

Emphatic pronouns are the same as reflexive pronouns. They are used with a noun or a pronoun. Emphatic pronouns are used for emphasizing the noun or the pronoun it is used with. The examples of emphatic pronouns in the sentences are:
1. She *herself* made the cake.
2. You *yourself* should be sorry.
3. He *himself* bought a watch.
4. I *myself* cleaned the window.
5. The cat drank the milk *itself*.
6. I saw him leave *myself*.

If we remove the emphatic pronouns from the sentence, the sentence will still be meaningful. But if we remove a reflexive pronoun from the sentence, the sentence will not be meaningful. For example;
1. He *himself* played the match.
In this sentence, if we remove the emphatic pronoun *himself*, the sentence will still be meaningful, i.e.,
'He played the match.'

2. She bought a new toy for *herself*.
In this sentence, if we remove the reflexive pronoun *herself*, the sentence will not be meaningful, i.e.,
'She bought a new toy for.'
(This sentence is not complete.)

# Interrogative Pronoun

(pronoun-5)

We know that pronouns are the words used to replace one or more nouns. Apart from personal, possessive, demonstrative, and reflexive pronouns, we have another type of pronoun called interrogative pronoun.

These are used to ask questions. The sentences with interrogative pronouns always end with question marks. There are five different types of Interrogative pronouns:

1. What
2. Which
3. Who
4. Whom
5. Whose

Some examples of interrogative pronouns:

1. What is your name?
2. Which is your favorite food?
3. Who did this?
4. Whom did you meet yesterday?
5. Whose bike is this?

## Indefinite Pronouns

Indefinite pronouns are used in a general way. They do not refer to any particular person, quantity, or thing. These are used in a general way, without clarifying exactly 'who'.
Example: anything, everybody, someone, nobody, nothing, few, several, etc.

Examples of indefinite pronouns in sentences are:
1. Can I have _another_ piece of cake?
2. I can have _either_ book.
3. They bought _everything_ they wanted.
4. We have _less_ than we paid for.
5. I do not know _anything_ about the music.
6. _Somebody_ has stolen my watch.

Indefinite pronouns are both singular and plural. In addition, some pronouns are singular in some contexts and plural in other contexts. Singular indefinite pronouns are used with singular verbs and plural indefinite pronouns are used with plural verbs.

Singular indefinite pronouns:
Another, Anybody, Anyone, Anything, Each, Either, Enough, Everybody, Everyone, Everything, Less, Little, Much, Neither, Nobody, No-one, Nothing, One, Other, Somebody, Someone, Something.

## Relative Pronouns

Relative pronouns are used to refer to the nouns mentioned previously, modify them, or add something to them. These pronouns can also be used to join sentences. 
Example: who, whose, whom, which, that, what, when, where, whoever, whichever, whomever.

Sample sentences:
1. I do not like people _who_ tease others.
2. She said she completed her homework, _which_ was a lie.
3. _Whoever_ wants to come, is welcome.
4. The cake _that_ you gave me was very tasty.
5. Animals know the people by _whom_ they are treated well.
6. Take _whichever_ you want.
7. This is the place _where_ we met.

The relative pronoun can be confused with the interrogative pronoun. The difference between them is that the relative pronoun is used to connect the phrases to the noun or pronoun. On the other hand, interrogative pronouns are used to ask questions.
Example:
A woman _who_ lost her purse is at the police station.
In this sentence, 'who' is a relative pronoun.

_Who_ are you?
In this sentence, "who" is an interrogative pronoun.
