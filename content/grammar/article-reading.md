# Articles - Introduction

**a**, **an** and **the** are known as articles. They are used in front on naming words (nouns).

**an** is used with the word that begins with a vowel sound. We already know that **a**, **e**, **i**, **o** and **u** are called vowels. The remaining 21 letters are called consonants.

an apple, an animal, an egg, an eagle, an ice-cream, an owl, an umbrella

**a** is used with the word that begins with a consonant sound.

a bag, a bird, a cat, a cup, a dog, a pen, a tree

Though the below words begin with **u**, the beginning sound is **you**. So it is not considered as a vowel sound.

a universe, a uniform

Though the below words begin with **h**, the first letter is silent. So the initial sound of the word is a vowel.

an hour, an honest

**a** and **an** are used to refer any one of the things. But **the** is used to refer to a specific thing.

 I went to a doctor. The doctor was very kind.
 
 In the first sentence we use **a** before the word **doctor** because she is one of the many doctor. But in the second sentence we use **the** because we are speaking about a particular doctor whom we visited.
 
 # Definite and Indefinite Article
 
 Articles are of two types â€“ the definite article (the) and the indefinite article (a/an).
 
 ## Indefinite articles:
 
 The indefinite articles "a/an" are generally used to mention some person or thing. These articles do not specify a particular person or a thing. "A" and "An" are used to introduce noun or naming words and are also used to mention singular countable nouns.
 
  "a" is used before singular nouns beginning with consonant sounds.
  
  "an" is used before singular nouns beginning with vowel sounds.
  
 ## Definite article:
  
  We use definite article "the" when we are talking about a specific person or a thing.
  
  "the" is used for countable and uncountable nouns/singular and plural nouns.
