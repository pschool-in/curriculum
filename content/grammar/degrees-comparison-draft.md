# Degrees of Comparison

The Degrees of Comparison in English grammar are made with the Adjective and Adverb words to
show the qualities of noun (person,place,things).
```
Adjectives:-Small, big, large, beautiful, fast, wise, healthy, easy, good.
Adverbs:-Slowly, beautifully, easily. quickly, badly, eagerly.
```

Every adjective and adverb can be written in one of three degrees
```
Positive degree
Comparative degree
Superlative degree
```

## Positive Degree
The positive degree of an adjective or adverb offers no comparison. Only adjective word used without “er, est, more and most”. (...as+adjective+as;
...so+adjective+as)

```
eg:
Vijay is a tall boy.
Priya is a beautiful girl in her class.
Jeni is as clever as Janu.
```
## Comparative Degree

This compares two things to show which has the lesser or greater degree of the quality.
```
● [add “er” (one syllable word) and Add “More” (more than one syllable) to an
adjective to form the comparative degree.
● [adjective+than- is used in comparative degree]
```
```
eg:

Balu is taller than Ramu.
Sheela is more beautiful than Rani.
```

## Superlative Degree:
This compares more than two things to show which has the least or greatest degree of the
quality. Add “est” (one syllable word) and Add “Most” (more than one syllable) to an
adjective to form the superlative degree. (the+adjective)- is used in comparative degree.
