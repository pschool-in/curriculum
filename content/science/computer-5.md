## Computer System - Reading

### What is a computer?
A computer is an electronic device that accepts data, stores it and processes it to give a result. It uses the input data to give desired outputs based on the instruction that is given. A  computer is made up of hardware and software devices.

### Hardware
All the parts of the computer that can be touched or connected to the computer include hardware devices.
Examples of hardware devices are a monitor, keyboard, CPU, mouse, printer, and speaker.
The computer hardware is classified into two.
1. Internal Hardware: the parts that are inside the CPU comprise internal hardware. They include the motherboard, hard disc drive, microprocessor, RAM, etc
2. External Hardware: the parts that are connected to the outside of the computer system include external hardware. They include monitor, keyboard, speaker, etc

### Software
It is a set of instructions or programs on which the computer works. Some examples are web browsers, games, Windows OS, Microsoft Word, etc
The software can be classified into two groups.
1. System software: these are programs that control and manage all the activities of a computer. Operating system (OS) is an example of system software. It is the interface between a user and the computer.
2. Application software: it is run by the system software. It allows users to perform specific tasks.

### Working of a computer
A computer accepts raw data as input and processes it with help of programs and gives an output. A computer has four functions.
1. Accepts data (Input): it is the raw information entered into a computer from the input devices.
2. Processes data (Process): it is the work done on input data. It is done by CPU.
3. Produce result (Output): it is the final result a computer gives out.
4. Store result (Storage): computer stores data in storage devices for later use.

### Input devices
They are used to provide data and instruction to the computer. Commonly used input devices are: Keyboard, Microphone, Scanner, Barcode reader, Webcam, Light pen, Joystick, Touchpad, Light pen, Digital camera, etc

### Output Devices 
They provide output. Output can be of two formats. The output we see on the monitor is softcopy. The printed copy of the output is the hard copy. Commonly used output devices are: Monitor, Printer, Speakers, Headphone, etc

### Central Processing Unit (CPU)
It is the brain of the computer. It is made of three components.
1. Control unit
2. Arithmetic logic unit
3. Memory unit

### Storage devices
It is used to store data. The most common storage devices are: Hard disc, Compact disc, Digital versatile disc , Blu-ray disc, USB flash drive, Memory card, etc
