## Materials

We can see lot of things around us. The matter from which a thing is made of is called Material. For example: Chair is made of wood, Eraser is made of rubber, Candle is made of wax.

### Properties of Materials

We can measure, see or feel the materials. Different types of material have different properties that make them useful for various purposes. Most materials have more than one property. They can be hard or soft, shiny or dull, smooth or rough and flexible or rigid.

### Hard and Soft

Materials which cannot be easily compressed, cut, bent or scratched are called hard materials. eg: brick, bone and steel.

Materials which can be easily compressed, cut, bent or scratched are called soft materials. eg: foam, clay and skin.

### Shiny and Dull

Materials which reflect the light well are called shiny materials. eg: stainless steel, gold and diamond.

Materials which do not reflect the light well are called dull materials. eg : candle, paper and jute bag.

### Rough and Smooth

Materials which have ups and downs on their surface are called rough materials. eg: brick, rock and tyre.

Materials which do not have ups and downs on their surface are called smooth materials. eg: mirror, silk cloth and tiles.

### Flexible and Rigid

Materials which can be bent or stretched easily are known as flexible materials. eg: rubber band, electric wire and cycle tube.

Materials which cannot be bent or stretched easily are known as rigid materials. eg: stick, wooden scale and stone.

### Waterproof Materials

Materials that do not allow water to pass through them are called Waterproof Materials. eg : raincoat and aluminium foil of tablet strip.

## Hard vs Soft

Classify the below as hard and soft materials.

Hard - wood, brick, bone, steel

Soft - eraser, cotton, foam, clay, skin

## Shiny vs Dull

Shiny - stainless steel, gold, diamond, mirror

Dull - candle, paper, jute bag, wood

## Rough vs Smooth

Classify the below as rough and smooth materials.

Rough - brick, rock, tyre

Smooth - mirror, silk cloth, tiles, plate

## Flexible vs Rigid

## Multiple Choice Questions

```
Materials that can be bent are called _____.
flexible, soft, hard, rigid

Which of the following is not a soft material?
mirror, clay, skin, cotton

The materials that does not allow water to pass through are called _________ materials.
waterproof, dry, wet, hard

Which of the following is called the natural source of light?
The Sun, The Moon, Electric light, Torch light

Which of the following is not made of rubber?
candle, tyre, eraser
```

## True or False

```
True:
Gold and diamond are examples of shiny material.
Aluminium foil of tablet strips are waterproof.
Plastic scale is flexible but wooden scale is not flexible.

False:
Car tyres are smooth.
Cycle tube is not flexible.

Pick the odd one out.

```
silk cloth, brick, coir, pine apple
stone, rubber band, cycle tube, electric wire
pen, sun, candle, torch
sponge, umbrella, rain coat, jerkin

```


## Light

We see the world around us with the help of light. Where do we get light from? Light may come either from the Sun or from other sources like an electric lamp or a bulb. The objects that give off light are called light sources.

### Transparent,Translucent and Opaque objects

Transparent objects allow the light to pass through them. So, we can see things on the other side of the object. eg: air, glass and pure water.

Translucent objects allow some light to pass through them. So, we cannot see objects clearly, but we see them as blurred images through them. eg: paper soaked in oil, snow and vegetable oil.

Opaque objects do not allow light to pass through them. So, we cannot see through these objects. eg : wood, stone and metals.

### Experiment

Material Required: torch light, mirror, dark room

Direct the torch light on the mirror. You can observe the light getting reflected and falling on some other part of the room. If we tilt the mirror, the position of the reflected light changes.

## True or False

Classify the below sentences as true and false

```
True:
We see the world around us with the help of light.
Paper soaked in oil is translucent.

False:
All solids are opaque.
Transparent objects are invisible to human eyes.
If we tilt the mirror, the direction of reflection does not change.
```

## Drag and Drop

Drag and drop the words at proper place.

```
We see the world around us with the help of *light*.
The objects that give off light are called light *sources*.
Light usually get *reflected* from mirror.
