What is an Environment?

The environment is a surrounding that have living things such as plants, animals, human beings, insects, and non-living things such as, soil, stone, mountain, etc.
Every thing in the environment adapt itself to live and interact with each other. A good life will start from a healthy environment. 

### Living thing and Non-living thing
Things in surroundings can be divided into two types as living and non-living things. Living things are able to live, breathe, consume, grow, die, reproduce. For example Human beings, animals, plants, trees, bacteria, fungus, etc. Plants and trees will also come under the living thing, but they cannot move from one place to another. Other than mobility, plants and trees can do everything like breathe, grow, die, etc.
Non-living things are not alive. So, non-living things do not breathe, live, eat, reproduce, etc. Moreover, they cannot move from one place to another on their own. For example Stone, chair, house, etc.

### Relationship of all things in the environment

Living things and non-living things are connected to the environment. For example, birds live in a nest. To build the nest, they need twigs, cotton, threads, etc. So, they will take from the environment. For example, Silk, cotton, wool are available in the environment which will help to weave the clothes/ dresses. Living things will also support the environment to keep it healthy.For example: Usually, some seeds from the plants will be scattered in the soil/ ground by the wind. In addition, animals, insects will also scatter the seeds to the soil unknowingly. So, those seeds will grow as new plants that will help the environment. Usually living things will bring changes even in non-living things. Some types of animals will hunt and eat the raw flesh from other living animals or dead animals. The remaining part of the dead animals will start to decay in the soil, which will turn into manure for the trees and plants by make the soil fertile.Thus, all living things and non-living things are dependant upon each other.

## Reading

### Different types of Animals, Insects, and Birds

Our mother nature is full of diversity. On our planet, there are different types of animals, birds, and insects with different colors, shapes, sizes. All of them will move in different ways.  Moreover, every type has its unique characteristics. Many animals live on land and some reside in water. Some live both in water and land. Birds will be there in land and air. Some birds will be there in both water and land. Birds and animals are grouped in different ways. Mammal is one of the most important categories. Some kinds of animals/ birds will come under mammals, whereas some of them are not mammals. The mammals usually give the milk to their young owns, for example; cows, goats, pigs, rats, dogs, etc. Usually, mammals have presence of mammary glands and they will have hair in their body.

### Different Sizes

Animals like cows, elephants, horses, goats, etc., are there in different types of sizes. Some are small, some are big and some are medium-sized animals.  For example Elephants, giraffes are big size animals. Dogs, goats are medium-sized animals. Squirrels, rats are small-sized animals. Insects are also tiny ones, where they have their unique characteristics. 

### Different colors

Moreover, some varieties of animals, birds, and insects will have different color patterns in their body. For example, the peacock will have many colors on its body. Five-colored parrot Brett is one type of bird variety in which has 5 different types of colors in its body.

### Different ways of the Birds

Birds will have two legs and have two wings, to fly. Their body will be covered with feathers. Every type of bird can fly in the sky, but the ability to flying a distance will vary. For example, an eagle will fly higher in the sky and it can stay long back in the sky itself, whereas pigeons will not able to fly high and it will come down very soon. 

### Different ways of the Animals

Animals have four legs and every type of animals move in different ways. Some animals will run very fast, whereas some animals will move very slowly. For example, on the land; the cheetah is the fastest animal and the tortoise is the slowest animal. Reptiles are also classified under animals. Moreover, some reptiles will move at normal speed and some reptiles will move very fast. For example, snakes and crocodiles are reptiles, however, snakes move much faster when compared to crocodiles on land. Most of the reptiles will crawl and have scales on their body. Moreover, some of the reptiles have short legs and some types of reptiles do not have legs. For example, snakes don't have legs, and lizards have short legs.  

### Different ways of the Insects

Some insects will fly in the air, as well as they move on the land also. There are much variety of insects and they are also with different characteristics. Insects also have wings, but we will not call them birds. Examples are mosquitoes, houseflies, butterflies, etc. Usually, most insects have six legs and it’s smaller than birds. But some insects will have eight legs. 

### Different ways of the Fish

Fishes live and breathe in water. There are many different types of fishes and every type has its unique characteristic feature. Fishes have fins and scales in their body. Fish uses fins to move in the water. Fishes use their gills to breathe in water. Fishes cannot survive on land and they cannot walk on land. Some unique fishes are there that can survive on moist-land also, for example, the mud-fish.

Interesting facts - Bats have wings in their body, but they don’t have feathers on the body. Bats are not birds like the crow, peacock, parrot, etc. It is classified under the cold-blooded animal. 

### Domestic animals and Wild animals:

Animals and birds can be categorized into two types. They are domestic and wild.  Domestic animals can be tamed and they will not do any harm, whereas wild animals will harm us. Wild animals can be seen in the places like forests, zoos. Examples: lions, foxes, bears, tigers, etc. Some types of animals /birds can stay along with us in the home. They will not do any harm to us and they are called as Domestic animals. will always give good support to humans and help us in many ways. For example, cows, goats, buffalo. There are some types of animals and insects which will enter our house, which is of no use for us. For example, some types of animals and insects like rats, mice, bed bugs, spiders, etc will come to our home and they will create disturbance for us.

Chapter: maha g4:The Inter-relationships between Living Things

## Reading

### The Inter-relationships between Living Things

Living things take their necessary things from the environment. All living things need food, water, air for survival and it is fulfilled in the environment. Moreover, there are more differences in needs for every living organism. The necessity will change from one to another living things. You can find the living things in their suitable place, where its necessary things are getting fulfilled. For example; a Lemon tree lives in the land, but it will not survive in a pond or lake or ocean or sea. 

### Animals Need

Animals need is fulfilled in the environment. Animals can live in the area where it is getting supported by the environment. Fish lives in water, but it is very difficult to survive in the land. Tiger has stripes on its body and it will hide in tall grasses to hunt its prey. Those stripes will help the tiger camouflage so that its prey cannot able to find the tiger. Tiger is dependent upon its prey animals like deer, wild pigs, buffalo, etc. Moreover, they are dependent upon the waterhole, dense vegetation, and also need caves or dens for their shelter. Similarly, many animals will depend upon the plants, animals, and other surroundings in the environment. Some animals will come under herbivores, some will come under carnivores and some animals will come under omnivores.

### Animals and trees support each other

Some animals live on trees as well as on land also. For example, animals like monkeys, squirrels, etc., will live on both trees and land. In this case, both trees and animals help each other. Trees will give fruits, vegetables to these animals. Sometimes monkeys can use the tress to defend themselves from their enemies. Suck kind of animals are called Arboreal (living in trees). Even birds build their nest in the tree.  Moreover, unknowingly these animals support the trees. These animals will move and roam in the surroundings and spread the seeds unknowingly. While roaming, these kinds of animals and birds spread the seeds in the land and it will help in growing the new plants.

### Human’s Need

Animals and plants give us abundantly and they are satisfying our needs. Similar to other living things, we humans also take care of some animals for our domestic use. Those animals will be called domestic animals. These animals will give their products like milk, meat, eggs, etc. Moreover, some animals help us in transportation, agriculture, etc. Besides, we use the excreta of domestic animals. For example, cattle dung will be made into dung cakes. They are combustible and used as fuel. Plants give us vegetables, fruits, flowers, seeds, and many products for our daily use. For example, from cotton wool plants, we will get the cotton to weave our clothes. Moreover, many plants have more medicinal values and their extraction is used as medicines.

### Seasons

We have four seasons and they are summer, winter, spring, autumn, or fall. Every season we will have changes in the environment. For example, during the summer season, there will be sunny and we used to wear cotton clothes. During the winter season, there will be cold and we wear woolen or warm clothes to shield ourselves from the cold. It will give changes to other living things too. For example, the animals which have fur will become much thicker during the winter season.  During the spring seasons, fresh buds will start to bloom and it is the season of new beginnings. During the autumn (fall) seasons, trees leave changing color and some trees will lose their leaves. Not only trees, change in seasons will affect all living things.

Chapter: tn-3-3-science: Our Environment

## Reading

### Biotic Factors 

Biotic factors are the living organisms in our environment. For example; Trees and Plants, Animals, Birds, Human beings, etc.

### Abiotic factors 

Abiotic factors are the non-living organisms in our environment. For example; Temperature, Water, air, stone, mountain, etc.

### Difference between Biotic factors and Abiotic factors

Biotic factors are also called living things and abiotic factors are also called non-living things. Biotic factors can feel, breathe and grow. They need food for living and they will give birth to young ones. Abiotic factors do not grow and breathe. They cannot feel and food is not necessary for them. Besides, they do not give birth to young ones. Moreover, all abiotic and biotic factors are linked together in the environment by the flow of energy via food. Living things and non-living things interact with one another in the environment. Moreover, plants are not able to move from one place to another, but they will be able to grow and also their branches will develop well. Plants can make prepare their food by using abiotic factors like soil, water, air, sunlight, etc. Every biotic factor depends on other things for food in the environment.

### Balanced – Ecosystem

 The food chain plays a more important role in every biotic/ living thing in the environment. Living things are dependent on both living things and non-living things for food, survival in this ecosystem. Based on consumption of food, living things/ biotic factors are categorized into three types. They are Producers, Consumers, and Decomposers. Our ecosystem supports living things such as plants, animals, human beings, and also micro-organisms to grow in the environment.
 
 ### Producers
 
 Some types of living things can able to prepare their food by themselves and they are called producers. For example, Plants & trees are classified under producers. Plants will prepare the food by the process called photosynthesis. Plants are also called primary producers. Moreover, humans and animals depend upon plants for their food. Some types of plants do not prepare their food by themselves and they will depend upon other plants for food. These types of plants are called parasitic plants. For example, Cuscuta. 
 
 ### Consumers
 
 Some types of living things are not able to produce food on their own and it is dependent for food on plants and animals for its survival. They are called Consumers and they can be classified into three categories. They are Herbivores, Carnivores and Omnivores. When living things are dependent fully on plants for their food and they are called Herbivores. When living things eats only flesh animals for their food and they are called Carnivores. When living things are dependent fully on plants and animal's flesh (meat) for their food and they are called Omnivores.
 
 ### Decomposers
 
 Microorganisms that feed on the decaying waste such as dead plants and animals for their survival and are called decomposers. Those micro-organisms support the environment by giving nutrients to the soil. So soil turns more fertile and this helps to grow the plants and trees well.  For example; Bacteria, fungi, etc.
