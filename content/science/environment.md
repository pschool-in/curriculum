What is an Environment?

The environment is a surrounding that has living things like plants, animals, human beings, insects, and non-living things such as, soil, stone, mountain, etc.
All things in the environment will adapt themselves to live and interact with each other. A good life will start from a healthy environment. 

### Living thing and Non-living thing
Things in surroundings can be divided into two types. They are living things and non-living things. 
Living things are things where they can able to live, breathe, eat food, grow, die, reproduce young ones, and also it can able to move from one place to another on their own. For example Human beings, animals, plants, trees, bacteria, fungus, etc. Plants and trees will also come under the living thing, but they cannot able to move from one place to another. Other than moving, plants and trees can do everything like breathe, grow, die, etc.
Non- living things are the things that are not alive. So, non-living things will not able to breathe, live, eat food, reproduce, etc. Moreover, they will not move from one place to another on their own. For example Stone, chair, house, etc.

### Relationship of all things in the environment

Living things and non-living things will be connected to the environment. For survival, living things will take their necessary things from the environment.
For example, birds live in a nest. To build the nest, they need twigs, cotton, threads, etc. So, they will take from the environment. 
Humans also will take their necessary things from the environment. For example, Silk, cotton, wool are available in the environment. So, these things will help to weave the clothes/ dresses.
Humans making many things like paper, baskets, mats, etc., from the environment. Living things will also support the environment to keep a healthy environment.
For example: Usually, some seeds from the plants will be scattered in the soil/ ground by the wind. In addition, animals, insects will also scatter the seeds to the soil unknowingly. 
So, those seeds will grow as new plants in new places. This will help the environment to be healthy. Usually living things will bring changes even in non-living things.
Living things will take many things from the environment. Some types of animals will hunt and eat the raw flesh from other living animals or dead animals. 
The remaining part of the dead animals will start to decay in the soil. After some time, those decay will turn into manure for the trees and plants. 
Moreover, this will make the soil fertile. As a result, plants and trees will get good nourishment from the fertile soil. 
Thus, all living things and non-living things are depending upon each other. Sometimes humans are making harm to the environment by pollution. 
So we should not harm things to the environment.
