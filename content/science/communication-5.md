## Communication and Mass Media - Reading

### Communication
Communication is simply the act of transferring information from one place, person, or group to another. Every communication involves at least one sender, a message and a recipient. Artificial satellites are used in
modern methods of communication. The signals are delivered very quickly from one point to another. In India, we use artificial satellites
for communication. These satellites are called the Indian National Satellites (INSAT).
