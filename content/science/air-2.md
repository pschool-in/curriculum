## AIR

## Chapter: maha g 3 : Our Need for Air

Air is all around us, even though we cannot see it. But we are able to feel air. Air does not have colour, smell,or taste.

We need air to breathe. Inhalation and exhalation are together called breathing. We breathe continuously and this process is called respiration.

We need air for our body to function properly. It also makes us feel fresh and lively. We require air to produce the energy that we need to work properly.

# GRADE 4

## AIR

## Chapter: maha g4:Air

### Atmosphere
The earth we live on is round in shape. There exist a blanket of air surrounding the earth. This blanket of air is known as atmosphere. The atmosphere is as high as 50km.

As we go farther from the earth, the layer of air becomes thin. The air at greater heights is rarer and the layers of air are also not held close together.

Air plays a role in burning. The component of air that helps in burning is a gas called oxygen. Oxygen is also used for respiration by us. Another component of air is carbon dioxide which is used by plants to make food. However, the largest component in air is nitrogen. Air has several gases mixed in it therefore, air is called a mixture of gases.

Some fuels like coal, petrol and diesel give out smoke while burning. This mixes with air and pollutes it.

## Match the following

Match the gases with their respective percentages in air.

```
Nitrogen, 78%
Oxygen, 21%
Argon, 0.93%
Carbon dioxide, 0.04%
Other gases, small quantities

```

## Fill in the Blanks (using options)

```
About *78% (97%)* of air is made up of nitrogen.
About *21% (50%)* of air is made up of oxygen.
As we go higher from the surface of the earth, the air in the atmosphere becomes *rarer (denser)*.
*Oxygen (carbon dioxide) is required for burning.
Plants use *carbon dioxide (oxygen) to make food. 
The fizzy bubbles in soft drinks are due to the presence of *carbon dioxide (nitrogen)*.

```

## True or False

```
True:
Plants need carbon dioxide to prepare food
Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air.
Oxygen is required to produce energy to do work.

False:
We exhale oxygen.
We inhale carbon dioxide.
At heights air is denser. 

```
## Odd one out

Pick the odd one out.

```
atmosphere, stratosphere, *biosphere*. 
oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, *xenon*. 

```
## Answer in one word. (drag and drop)

```
Burning of fossil fuels release smoke - *air pollution*
Layer of atmosphere that protects us from UV rays - *ozone*
Largest component of air - *nitrogen*
Mixture of several gases - *air*

```
## Fill in the blanks. (drag and drop)

``` 

The layers of air in the atmosphere close to the earth are pressed *closer* to each other while the upper layers are rarer.
There is *air* even in an empty container.
The air at a greater height from the earth is *rarer* than the air nearer to the earth.
If all the air were divided into five parts, the oxygen in the air would equal to *one* part.
There is air till a height of about *50*km from the earth.
The layers of air nearer the earth bear *more* weight than the upper layers.
