## AIR

## Chapter: maha g 3 : Our Need for Air

Air is all around us, even though we cannot see it. But we are able to feel air. Air does not have colour, smell,or taste.

We need air to breathe. Inhalation and exhalation are together called breathing. We breathe continuously and this process is called respiration.

We need air for our body to function properly. It also makes us feel fresh and lively. We require air to produce the energy that we need to work properly.

## AIR

## Chapter: maha g4:Air

### Atmosphere
The earth we live on is round in shape. There exist a blanket of air surrounding the earth. This blanket of air is known as atmosphere. The atmosphere is as high as 50km.

As we go farther from the earth, the layer of air becomes thin. The air at greater heights is rarer and the layers of air are also not held close together.

Air plays a role in burning. The component of air that helps in burning is a gas called oxygen. Oxygen is also used for respiration by us. Another component of air is carbon dioxide which is used by plants to make food. However, the largest component in air is nitrogen. Air has several gases mixed in it therefore, air is called a mixture of gases.

Some fuels like coal, petrol and diesel give out smoke while burning. This mixes with air and pollutes it.

## Match the following

Match the gases with their respective percentages in air.

```
Nitrogen, 78%
Oxygen, 21%
Argon, 0.07%
Carbon dioxide, 0.03%
Other gases, small quantities

```

## Fill in the Blanks (using options)

```
About *78% (97%)* of air is made up of nitrogen.
About *21% (50%)* of air is made up of oxygen.
As we go higher from the surface of the earth, the air in the atmosphere becomes *rarer (denser)*.
*Oxygen (carbon dioxide) is required for burning.
Plants use *carbon dioxide (oxygen) to make food. 
The fizzy bubbles in soft drinks are due to the presence of *carbon dioxide (nitrogen)*.

```

## True or False

```
True:
Plants need carbon dioxide to prepare food
Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air.
Oxygen is required to produce energy to do work.

False:
We exhale oxygen.
We inhale carbon dioxide.
At heights air is denser. 

```
## Odd one out

Pick the odd one out.

```
atmosphere, stratosphere, *biosphere*. 
oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, *xenon*. 

```
## Answer in one word. (drag and drop)

```
Burning of fossil fuels release smoke - *air pollution*
Layer of atmosphere that protects us from UV rays - *ozone*
Largest component of air - *nitrogen*
Mixture of several gases - *air*

```
## Fill in the blanks. (drag and drop)

``` 

The layers of air in the atmosphere close to the earth are pressed *closer* to each other while the upper layers are rarer.
There is *air* even in an empty container.
The air at a greater height from the earth is *rarer* than the air nearer to the earth.
If all the air were divided into five parts, the oxygen in the air would equal to *one* part.
There is air till a height of about *50*km from the earth.
The layers of air nearer the earth bear *more* weight than the upper layers.

```

## Multiple Choice Question

```
Air is _________ than water.
Lighter, heavier, denser, rarer

As we go farther from the earth, the layers of air become ________.
Thinner, thicker, lighter

The gas that fizzes out of soda-water is _________.
Carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen

## AIR

## Chapter: tn-4-3-science: Air we breathe

### Importance of air in our daily life.

+ Oxygen present in air is needed for respiration.
+ We can speak and hear the sound only when there is air around.
+ Air helps in the dispersal of seeds for plant reproduction.
+ Monsoon and rain occurs due to the wind action.
+ Air regulates the atmospheric temperature.

Air shows the properties of all the gases present in it.

### Nitrogen

+ It is used to fill up food packages to extend their shelf life.
+ Liquid nitrogen is used to store living cells.
+ Plants need nitrogen for their growth.
+ We can see root nodules containing nitrogen in some plants.
+ Nowadays people use nitrogen gas to fill the tires of their vehicles. 
+ Some compounds of nitrogen are used as explosives also.

### Oxygen

+ It can be tested with a piece of glowing splint, which relights in oxygen.
+ All living things use oxygen for breathing.
+ Oxygen is essential for burning.
+ Oxygen cylinders are used in hospitals to enable the patients to breathe when they cannot breathe normally.
+ Oxygen is used in gas welding.
+ Mountaineers carry oxygen cylinders at high altitudes.
+ Deep sea divers also carry oxygen cylinders along with them while
diving deep into the sea.

### Carbon dioxide

+ It can be tested with lime water. The lime water changes from colourless to milky.
+ Carbon dioxide helps plants in photosynthesis.
+ It is used in fi re extinguishers.
+ It is used in refrigerators as dry ice for
cooling purposes.
+ It is used to make plastics and polymers.

### Air pollution

The atmospheric balance is disturbed by human activities The air carries soot, smoke, and other particles from car exhaust and power plants. These are the major contributors to air pollution.

### Adverse effects of air pollution

+ Global warming
+ Formation of smog
+ Acid rain
+ Aerosol formation
+ Depletion of ozone

### Effects of air pollution on human beings

+ Irritation in the eyes, nose and throat
+ Wheezing, coughing and breathing problems
+ Respiratory diseases
+ Cardiovascular damage.
+ Fatigue, headaches and anxiety.
+ Nervous system damage.

### Steps to check air pollution

+ Alternative source of energy (E.g. Solar energy) should be used.
+ Air filters should be used to prevent harmful gases mixing with air.
+ Smoke emission test and certification of motor vehicles must be enforced.
+ More trees should be planted to absorb carbon dioxide.

Alternative source of energy are Solar Power, Nuclear Power,
Hydroelectric Energy, Wave Energy, Biofuels, Natural Gas, Geothermal
Power, Wind Energy, Biomass Energy, Tidal Energy and Hydrogen Gas.
