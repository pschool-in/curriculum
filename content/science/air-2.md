## Chapter: maha g 3 : Our Need for Air

Air is all around us, even though we cannot see it. But we are able to feel air. Air does not have colour, smell,or taste.

We need air to breathe. Inhalation and exhalation are together called breathing. We breathe continuously and this process is called respiration.

We need air for our body to function properly. It also makes us feel fresh and lively. We require air to produce the energy that we need to work properly.
