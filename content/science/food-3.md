Why food is important?

Every day we feel hungry and then eat something. Our body is telling us that it
needs food. Why do we need food?

1. Food gives us energy to work and play.
2. Food builds our body.
3. Food keeps us healthy.

We eat different food items, some are raw and some are cooked. Each of these
food items contains different nutrients. There are five main nutrients that our
body requires. They are carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals.

### Carbohydrates

Our body needs energy to do work, play and do other activities. Carbohydrates
are energy-giving food. Food that contains carbohydrate are rice, wheat, potato,
sugar cubes and bread.

### Proteins

Proteins build, maintain and replace the tissues in our body. They are also
known as body - building foods. E.g., Fish, Milk, Egg, Nuts and Sprouted seeds.

### Fats

Fats provide energy to us. They act as the body's energy reservoir. Fats also
help to keep the body warm during very cold weather. Too much fat in the body
may lead to obesity or overweight. Some food items that contain fat are cheese,
butter, ghee, meat, oil and nuts.

### Vitamins

Our body needs vitamins to work properly. They protect our body from deficiency
diseases. E.g., Carrot, Orange, Gooseberry, Papaya and Greens.

### Minerals

Minerals help in formation of blood, bone, teeth, etc. They regulate the body
functions. E.g., Fig, Pear, Garlic, Banana and Apple.

Most children love to eat food items like burgers, pizzas and chocolates, which
are not good for health. They make children to gain extra weight. Avoid eating
unhealthy foods and eat nutritious food to stay healthy. A healthy snack may
include sprouts, fruits and salads.
