# Chapter maha-4: Storage of Water

## Reading

### Old water stores

These ways were used by previous generations and are rarely in use these days.

#### Wells:

We know that rainwater seeps into the ground. So, wells were used to get this water.

#### Water tanks in forts:

The forts had reservoirs and tanks made of stone. It was used to store and conserve water.

#### Draw-wells:

These were small wells through which water was taken out using a bucket tied to a rope, further attached to a pulley or rotating rod.

#### Rivers and Bunds:

Bunds were built across the rivers to save water.

#### Old reservoirs and tanks:

These were built in areas that had scarcity of water or had no major rivers. Some large cities still have the old tanks and some of them are still in use.

### Recent systems of water storage

#### Dams:

This is the most important way of storing water as it is able to store water in large amounts and can even generate energy from it.

#### Borewells:

These wells are very deep and narrow. So, the groundwater is extracted with the help of electric pumps and motors.

### Do you know?

In some areas, big water jars, made of clay, are kept for road-side thirsty people. No charges are taken for drinking this water. These are known as Panpoi or Drinking Water Strands.
