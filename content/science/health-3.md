### Good touch, Bad Touch
There are body parts that you and others can see and touch like
our arms and hands. But, there are also some body parts that no one should see or touch like our chest, between our legs and our bottom. These parts are called private parts. 

It is never right for anyone to look at, touch or talk about your private parts. And it is never right for someone older to you to ask you to look, touch or talk about their private parts.

When we are small our mom or dad might touch us to help us to be clean. It is never a secret and it is okay to tell someone about it.

Some touches are good or safe, like when we shake hands. But, some touches are bad or unsafe, like when we hit someone. Bad touches might make you feel sad, angry, scared, or confused. If you do not like any touch or if it makes you sad, angry or scared, tell them to STOP! Scream “STOP!” and run away.

Tell an adult you trust, about the bad touch. Keep telling until you get the
help you need.

### Differently-abled
Not everybody can use all five senses. Some cannot use any one or more of them, such people are called Differently-abled.
Helping people is very honorable, and there are plenty of ways by which we can help differently-abled people.

1. Ask first if they need any help from you and follow their lead.
2. Speak clearly and listen to their words well.
3. Use direct words.
4. Never tease them by calling with specific names.
5. Be aware of their aids, do not cause any damage to the aids.
6. Open doors for the disabled.
7. Making way for them.
8. Help them to cross the road.
9. Treat them as normal people.
## Good vs Bad

```
Good:

Bad:
Stranger touching you without your permission.
Someone touching your private parts.
