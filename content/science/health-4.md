Chapter - mahag4: Home remedies for simple illness
## Home remedies - Reading

### Illness
When we are well, we feel hungry at the right times. We sleep well at night. We have no complaints about digestion. And most importantly, we feel refreshed on getting up in the morning. We do not feel tired even if we have been at work. But sometimes, for some reason, we fall ill.

Seema had a slightly sore throat. Still, she had some ice cream. The next day, her throat hurt and she found it difficult to swallow. Mother
made her gargle with warm salt water before and after school for two days. On the third day, Seema's throat had stopped hurting. This was a
simple illness and she soon felt better again.

A fortnight later, Seema's aunt fell ill. She was running a temperature. Her eyes had become yellow. She did not feel like eating anything. Mother took her to the doctor. The doctor said that her aunt had jaundice. The doctor advised her to take complete rest for three weeks. She also told
her to eat as little as possible of things that contain oil, ghee or butter. This was not an illness that could be cured easily.

### Home Remedies

If an illness gets cured readily, one can try a home remedy. Do you remember, Seema's mother made her gargle her throat with warm water. And Sakhu felt better in a day or two. 
Elderly, experienced people in the family sometimes suggest such cures.

If we have a cold we can inhale steam at bedtime or take hot fomentations on the chest.

If someone is vomiting as a result of fever or indigestion, it is better not to insist on him or her having a meal. At most, they should be given a cool lemon sherbet and something light, like Dahi Bhat, to eat the next day.

If someone has a cut, bruise or a small wound, it should be washed with clean water and dabbed dry. A tincture of iodine may be applied to it. Then it should be covered with clean cotton and bandaged.

Even if an illness appears to be minor, it should never be neglected. Remember, home remedies have limits. If a person does not recover in a day or two or if the illness worsens, one must go to a doctor.

Without a doctor’s advice, one should never take any medicine that must be swallowed.

### Society Health Service
A service that takes care of the health of the people and provides treatment for those who are ill is called a health service or medical service.
Big towns and cities have doctors’ clinics and hospitals. But, in most cities and rural areas there are Government Hospitals and Primary Health Centres too. Patients can get treatment at concessional rates there.
The municipal corporations of big cities also run hospitals that provide medical treatment.

### Points to remember
1. Some illnesses are cured quickly. But, some do not get cured easily.
2. Minor illnesses can be cured with home remedies. 
3. Experienced, elderly people in the family know of such home remedies.
4. For a cold, one can inhale steam or take hot fomentations.
5. A lemon sherbet is good for someone who is vomiting.
6. Mantras, incantations, magic spells and charms do not cure any diseases or illnesses.
