# maha g5: Food for all

## Reading

### Agriculture
60% of land in our country is used for agriculture. For agriculture, there are two main seasons in our country.
The season from June to October is called the kharif season. The season from October to March is rabi season.
In the kharif season, the crops are watered by rain. In rabi season, rainwater that has soaked into the soil, the retreating 
monsoons and dew are the sources of water for the crops.

### Methods of Irrigation
Water from rivers, lakes and wells is used for irrigation in addition to rainwater. Drip irrigation and sprinkle irrigation 
are two of these modern methods. The drip irrigation method makes use of pipes with holes and delivers water directly to the roots of plants.
Sprinkle irrigation makes use of sprinklers of different sizes that spray water directly on plants.

### Fertilizers and Pesticides
Fertilizers provide the required nutritive substances to the crop. There are two kinds of fertilizers, natural and chemical. Natural fertilizers
are obtained from materials available in nature like green waste and animal dung. Chemical fertilizers are mixtures of different chemical 
substances in specific proportions, useful for agriculture. Chemical fertilizers came to be used for quicker growth and higher yields.
Overuse of chemical fertilizers lowers the fertility of the soil and reduces its productivity.

It is important to avoid excessive use of fertilizers to protect the crops as overuse can damage the crops in fields. It is also important to
store the harvested crop safely. Stored grains can get damaged by fungi and insects. To prevent such damage, neem leaves are mixed with the gains.

### Food storage and conservation of environment

1. Green revolution- The  increase in food grain production (such as rice and wheat) due to the introduction of high-yielding varieties, the use of 
pesticides, and improved management techniques.
2. In 2013, India enacted a food security law that made it possible to fight against hunger and malnutrition.
3. Various agriculture assistance programmes are organised for farmers to inform them about the latest technology, irrigation facilities, pesticides, fertilizers etc.

maha g5- Methods of Preserving food
# Methods of Preserving Food (g5)

## Reading

### Food Preservation

1. In the winter season, to keep food longer foodstuffs are kept in the refrigerator.
2. Grains should be dried in sun before storing them
3. We should boil milk, curries and vegetables to prevent them from spoiling.
4. We should keep the food away from mice, rats and other insects.

Microorganisms are present all around us. If microorganisms grow, they spoil the food. The nutrition value of such food is decreased. 
Such food can cause diseases.

## Methods of Preservation

Drying- It is the process in which foodstuffs are dried to remove the water content.

Cooling- It is the process in which the foodstuffs are kept in the refrigerator. Through this process, micro-organisms do not get any warmth so
they are unable to grow.

Boiling- In this process the foodstuffs are boiled to destroy microorganisms.

Storing in airtight containers- In this process the foodstuffs are placed in airtight containers to ensure that water or air are not entered the foodstuff.

## Fill in the blanks (By drag and drop)

```
Microorganisms grow fast in the presence of air and *moisture*.
A *fungus* is a type of micro-organism.
Mango pulp and *milk* are foodstuffs that spoil quickly.
Food spoiled from micro-organisms can cause *diseases*.
*Airtight cans* ensure that water or air will not enter the foodstuff.

```

## True or False

```
True: 
We make efforts to preserve food to prevent them from getting spoiled.
Spices have a strong taste and are obtained from plants.

False:
Foodstuffs get warmth when they are stored in the refrigerator.
The process through which water content is lost is cooling.
Milk products are made and preserved for a whole year.

```

## Name the following (By drag and drop)

```
Food is dried to prevent water content. *Drying*
Food is rapidly frozen. *Freezing*
Food is placed in an airtight container. *Canning*
Food is stored in an airtight container under a vacuum. *Vacuum packing*
Soaking food in saltwater, vinegar or oil. *Pickling*

# Food (g5)

## Reading

Perishable foods get spoiled easily. The change in the normal state of food is called spoilage of food.

### Why food gets spoiled?

1. Air, oxygen and moisture can cause spoilage of food.
2. When foodstuffs are exposed to warmth it leads to the growth of microorganisms. Microorganisms multiply in food and spoil them.
3. Light produces colour changes and also vitamin loss. 
4. Enzymes are chemicals that are present in all foodstuffs. They speed up chemical changes that result in loss of flavour, colour and texture.

### Purpose of food preservation

1. To keep the food's colour, flavour, and nutritional value.
2. To ensure that food is available all year.
3. To prevent the growth of germs such as bacteria and fungi in food.
4. To reduce the wastage of food.
5. Food preservation not only protects our health but also ensures that food is available to those in need.

### Causes of diseases

Microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi cause diseases. Insects carry them, and theyÂ can also be spread by contaminated air and
water. When an organ's function is disturbed, it can lead to disease.

## Obesity

Obesity and overweight are both described as abnormal or excessive fat in the body that can harm one's health. Obesity is caused by an excess of calories consumed, a lack of physical activity, and genetic factors.

To avoid obesity and overweight, you must take the following steps.

1. Limit your intake of fast food, fried foods, and high-fat meat.

2. Include fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and nuts in your daily diet.

3. Engage in regular physical activity.

4. Make sure you get enough sleep.

### Types of diseases

Infectious disorders are caused by bacteria that enter and multiply within our bodies. Such diseases are passed from one person to the next.

Hereditary disorders are caused by genetic abnormalities. These diseases are passed from one generation to the next.

Physiological diseases are diseases that are caused by the malfunction of body organs.

Maintaining good health requires a diet that provides all important elements in the proper proportions. Deficiencies in one or more nutrients produce a 
variety of diseases. These are called deficiency diseases.

In marasmus, the child loses weight and the bones appear to be covered by skin. In Kwashiorkor, the child acquires a big belly, swollen face and feet.

Vitamin and mineral deficiencies can cause a variety of diseases. We can avoid these diseases by consuming vitamin and mineral-rich foods.

The food pyramid was created to encourage people to eat healthily. The requirements for certain nutrients vary from person to person depending on our work, age, and sex.

### Kitchen safety

1. The kitchen is a necessary part of our houses. The kitchen's equipment and surroundings maybe a little dangerous. As a result, we must take precautions and care.
2. Gas easily catches fire. There could be serious consequences if gas is released. As a result, we must exercise care when handling cylinders.
3. Wet hands should not be used to operate electrical appliances, as this might produce electric shocks.
4. Keep flammable materials such as kerosene and gasoline away from stoves.
5. Cover the victim with a heavy blanket or carpet if the person's clothes catch fire.
6. If kerosene or oil catches fire, put it out with sand.
7. If solid items, such as wood, catch fire, put it out with water.
8. If an electrical appliance catches fire, turn off the power and unplug the appliances.
9. To put out the fire, use the correct fire extinguishers.
10. In the event of small burns, the affected area should be held under cool running water for a few minutes before receiving medical attention.
