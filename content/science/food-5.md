# maha g5: Food for all

## Reading

### Agriculture
60% of land in our country is used for agriculture. For agriculture, there are two main seasons in our country.
The season from june to october is called the kharif season. The season from october to march is rabi season.
In the kharif seasoon, the crops are watered by rain. In rabi season, rainwater that has soaked into the soil, the retreating 
monsoons and dew are the sources of water for the crops.

### Methods of Irrigation
Water from rivers, lakes and wells is used for irrigation in addition to rainwater. Drip irrigation and sprinkle irrigation 
are two of these modern methods. The drip irrigation method makes use of pipes with holes and delivers water directly to the roots of plants.
Sprinkle irrigation makes use of sprinklers of different sizes that spray water directly on plants.

### Fertilizers and Pesticides
Fertilizers provide the required nutritive substances to the crop. There are two kinds of fertilizers, natural and chemical. Natural fertilizers
are obtained from materials available in nature like green waste and animal dung. Chemical fertilizers are mixtures of different chemical 
substances in specific proportions, useful for agriculture. Chemical fertilizers came to be used for quicker growth and higher yields.
Overuse of chemical fertilizers lowers the fertility of the soil and reduces its productivity.

It is important to avoid excessive use of fertilizers to protect the crops as overuse can damage the crops in fields. It is also important to
store the harvested crop safely. Stored grains can get damaged by fungus and insects. To prevent such damage, neem leaves are mixed with the gains.

### Food storage and conservation of environment
