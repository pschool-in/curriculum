# Work

An action in which one exerts a force to move an object is known as work. Force is applied to do some work.

When can we say that work is done or not? Two main conditions are needed for word to be done.

1. A force should act on an object.
2. Object should move from one place to another.

When the force acting on the object makes it move it is said to be done a work.

## Work or Not

Mention whether  work is done or not in the following activity.

```
Work Done:
Pushing the door
Digging soil
Riding a bicycle
Moving a trolly in a supermarket
Walking to school
Throwing a ball up

No Work Done:
Holding a doll
Sitting in a bus
Pushing a wall
Sleeping on bed
```


## Energy

A man pulls a luggage. To do so he needs some energy. But from where he gets the energy. Food gives energy to humans. A car moves by the energy obtained from the burning of fuel. The fuel used in car is usually petrol. The escalator moves by using electricity as energy. 

Energy is defined as capacity for doing work. Energy must be transferred to an object in order to do work.

### Renewable Energy

Renewable sources of energy are replaced naturally over a period of time. We can keep using these sources for a long period of time. Since the beginning of human life, we have been using these resources. We use these resources for light, transport, cooking, heating. eg: sun, wind and water.

The resources which are not easily replaced once used are called the non-renewable resources. eg: petrol, coal and natural gas

### Law of conservation

The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot created nor destroyed. It can be converted from one form to another. The SI unit of energy is joule. It is named after James Joule who explained about energy. 

## Multiple Choice Questions

```
Which of the following is not a source of renewable energy?
natural gas, wind, solar, water

If the object does not move on apply of force, then the work done is _______.
zero, very small, cannot be measured

What is required to move an object?
Force, Work, Machine, Energy

What does law of conservation of energy say?
Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed.
We get tired after doing lot of work.
We need to apply force to do work.

What is the SI unit of energy?
Joule, Newton, Push, Force
```

## Renewable Energy - classify

Classify the below.

Renewable Source - solar, wind, water

Non Renewable Source - petrol, coal, natural gas

## Drag and Drop

Drag and drop the words at proper place.

```
Energy is defined as *capacity* for doing work. Energy must be *transferred* to an object in order to do work.
Renewable sources of energy are *replaced* naturally over a period of time.
