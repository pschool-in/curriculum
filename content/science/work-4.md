# Work

An action in which one exerts a force to move an object is known as work. Force is applied to do some work.

When can we say that work is done or not? Two main conditions are needed for word to be done.

1. A force should act on an object.
2. Object should move from one place to another.

When the force acting on the object makes it move it is said to be done a work.

## Work or Not

Mention whether  work is done or not in the following activity.

```
Work Done:
Pushing the door
Digging soil
Riding a bicycle
Moving a trolly in a supermarket
Walking to school
Throwing a ball up

No Work Done:
Holding a doll
Sitting in a bus
Pushing a wall
Sleeping on bed
```


## Energy

A man pulls a luggage. To do so he needs some energy. But from where he gets the energy. Food gives energy to humans. A car moves by the energy obtained from the burning of fuel. The fuel used in car is usually petrol. The escalator moves by using electricity as energy. 

Energy is defined as capacity for doing work. Energy must be transferred to an object in order to do work.

### Renewable Energy

Renewable sources of energy are replaced naturally over a period of time. We can keep using these sources for a long period of time. Since the beginning of human life, we have been using these resources. We use these resources for light, transport, cooking, heating. eg: sun, wind and water.

The resources which are not easily replaced once used are called the non-renewable resources. eg: petrol, coal and natural gas

### Law of conservation

The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot created nor destroyed. It can be converted from one form to another. The SI unit of energy is joule. It is named after James Joule who explained about energy. 

## Multiple Choice Questions

```
Which of the following is not a source of renewable energy?
natural gas, wind, solar, water

If the object does not move on apply of force, then the work done is _______.
zero, very small, cannot be measured

What is required to move an object?
Force, Work, Machine, Energy

What does law of conservation of energy say?
Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed.
We get tired after doing lot of work.
We need to apply force to do work.

What is the SI unit of energy?
Joule, Newton, Push, Force
```

## Renewable Energy - classify

Classify the below.

Renewable Source - solar, wind, water

Non Renewable Source - petrol, coal, natural gas

## Drag and Drop

Drag and drop the words at proper place.

```
Energy is defined as *capacity* for doing work. Energy must be *transferred* to an object in order to do work.
Renewable sources of energy are *replaced* naturally over a period of time.
The escalator moves by using *electricity* as energy.
```



## Simple Machine

In our daily life our effort is saved with the help of some simple machines.

We draw water from the well with the help of a wheel and a rope.

Simple machines are tools which are used to make our work easier. Some examples for simple machines are pulley, wedge, inclined plane, screw, lever, wheel and axle.

A pulley is a machine made up of a wheel with a cut around it. A rope or chain passes around the pulley. It rotates in the direction with more force. eg: crane, well

An inclined plane is a flat sloping surface with one end higher than another. eg: ramp, slide and slope for wheel chair.

A wedge is a tool with a sharp edge which can be used to split materials. It is used to break wooden logs into two pieces. eg: knife, scissors and axe.

The screw is used to raise weights and to hold objects together. eg: pencil sharpener, screw-jack, bottle cap and windmill.

The screw in the bottle cap holds the cap and the bottle together. The blade and sharpner are held together by screw.

Wheel and axle consist of a wheel attached to a small rod so that these two parts rotate together. eg: bicycle wheel, door knob, grinder, axle wheel.

Simple machines usually exchange a smaller force to move a heavy object. The work required is the same, but the force required is less. 

### Lever

A lever is used to multiply the force we give on an object. eg: see saw, nut cracker and plier.

To understand the lever, we must know the following terms.

1. Load is the object on which the force is applied.
2. Effort is the force we apply on the lever.
3. Fulcrum is the point on which the lever rotates.

Lever is classified into three types according to where the load and effort are located with respect to fulcrum.

### Class I lever

When the fulcrum is between the effort and the load, it is known as Class I lever.eg: scissors, pliers, seesaw.

### Class II lever

When the load is between the effort and the fulcrum, it is known as Class II lever. eg: wheel barrow, lemon squeezer, nut cracker

### Class III lever

In this lever, the effort is between the load and the fulcrum. eg: stapler, tongs, broom stick, hockey stick.`
