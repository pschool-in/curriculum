How to find the directions?

There are mainly four directions: East, West, North and South.
1. The direction in which sun rises is east.
2. The direction in which sun sets is west.
3. East and west are opposite to each other.
4. When we face east, the north is to our left and the south is to our right.

Do you know, because the sun rises and sets every day, it is used to determine directions.

### Use of directions in maps
Directions are always shown in a map. They are indicated with an arrow pointing north. 
Before reading the map, make sure the directions on the map match the directions on the ground. This method will help you to read the maps.
