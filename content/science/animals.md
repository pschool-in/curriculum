# Animal Shelters (g3)

## Reading
Why do we need houses?

1. We live in houses to protect ourselves from very cold weather, gusty winds, scorching sun, heavy rains as they can cause us great discomfort .
2. A house also protects us from thefts.
3. It protects the people living close to the forests from wild animals.

Do you know, like us animals also need shelters to protect themselves? 
Some animals build shelter for themselves while others find them ready in the surroundings.

### Animals who build shelters for themselves
Birds build nests as they are afraid of the animals that eat eggs. Nests protects the young birds as they are too weak to protect themselves.
Nests are made up of grass, straw and twigs. They may even contain cotton, wool, and pieces of thread and string. 

### Animals that found ready shelters in the surroundings
Some animals do not make any efforts to build a shelter. They simply look around for a safe place. Some live
in small hollows in high cliffs or live near our houses. They find shelter in gaps in walls.

#### Fun Fact
It is believed that a cobra lives in an anthill. But anthills are built by ants, not by a
cobra. The cobras live in holes.

# The Life Cycle of Animals (g4)

## Reading
In animals, the babies either grow in their mother's tummy or hatch out of the eggs. Some animals like crows, spiders and lizards lay eggs. Unlike a chicken, their eggs are tiny. Some animals lay eggs that are too tiny to be observed with naked eyes.

### Hen
A hen lays eggs. The warmth which is provided by hen to her eggs, helps the chick inside the egg to grow. After the full growth, chicks breaks the egg shell and comes out.

Unlike, a chick which does not look very different from a hen, in some animals, the young one grows into an adult animal that looks
very different from the young one. This change of form is called metamorphosis.
