# Animal Shelters

## Reading
Why do we need houses?

1. We live in houses to protect ourselves from very cold weather, gusty winds, scorching sun, heavy rains as they can cause us great discomfort .
2. A house also protects us from thefts.
3. It protects the people living close to the forests from wild animals.

Do you know, like us animals also need shelters to protect themselves? 
Some animals build shelter for themselves while others find them ready in the surroundings.

### Animals who build shelters for themselves
Birds build nests as they are afraid of the animals that eat eggs. Nests protects the young birds as they are too weak to protect themselves.
Nests are made up of grass, straw and twigs. They may even contain cotton, wool, and pieces of thread and string. 

### Animals that found ready shelters in the surroundings
Some animals do not make any efforts to build a shelter. They simply look around for a safe place. Some live
in small hollows in high cliffs or live near our houses. They find shelter in gaps in walls.

#### Fun Fact
It is believed that a cobra lives in an anthill. But anthills are built by ants, not by a
cobra. The cobras live in holes.
