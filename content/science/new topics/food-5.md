## Food - Reading
### What our ancestors ate?
Our ancestors mainly depended on meat caught by hunting and fruits for their nutrition. They gathered fruit, nuts, plants, vegetables and seeds that were edible.

### Changes in food habits
Nowadays, we restrict our diet to few food groups. This diet does not provide us enough nutrients. This is a major cause for lifestyle diseases. To avoid this we need to strictly follow a balanced diet.

### Food shortage 
There are times when farmers are not able to grow enough food. Crops fail either because of lack of rainfall or due to floods. At times like these, the prices go up as the number of mouths to feed is far more than the food availability. In this case, it's the poor who suffer as they can no longer afford to buy food. Food shortages can also be created artificially. This happens when enough food is produced but is not released in the market in order to keep the prices high. Traders hoard food grains and make more money by selling them at higher prices.

### Taste buds
Taste buds are sensory organs that are found on the tongue and allow us to experience taste that are sweet, salty, sour and bitter. The front part of the tongue recognises the sweet taste while the sides of the tongue recognises sour and salty taste. The back part of the tongue recognises bitter taste.
