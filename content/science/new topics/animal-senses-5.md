### Animal Senses
We know that human beings have five sesnses. All animals have similar senses too but most of them have a aparticular sense that is well developed to match their specific survival needs. Moles, that live in the underground where it is dark have little use for good eyesight. They rely on a well developed sense of touch to find food. A spider relies on its eyesight to catch prey. Shark relies on its susperior sesnse of smell to follow the scent of a fish. It can detect even a small amount of blood in a large volume of water.

### Hearing 
A humpback whale communicates with beeps and calls that ssound like a somg. Other whwales can hear the songs miles away. Male humbacks repeat long songs that probably attract females and warn other males to keep away. Bats and whales find their way around by listening for echoes that bounce off objects. Birds have an acute sense of hearing too. Their ears are small openings in the skull protected by feathers. Birds are able to hear much sharper sounds than humans can. Ants do not have organs of hearing, but they have sensors on their feet and knees to pick up vibrations passing through leaves or the ground. Snakes do not have external ears but their inner ear is well developed . They can hear only low frequency sound or vibrations which travel through the bones to thier inner ear.

### Taste
Butterflies, bees and houseflies taste with their feet. Before, laying eggs on a plant, butterfly walks on the leaf to make sure it is edible for the caterpillar. A fly can feel with mouth parts, its antennae and its feet. A male moths feathery antennae can detect special floating chemicals given off by the female moth even if she is two or three kilometers away. A shark has group of taste buds all around the inside of its mouth and also on the front of its snout. A snakes tongue has no taste buds. The forked tongue is able to collect smells from two places at once and the stronger smell gives the snake a sense of direction. Smells and tastes are then separated in two pits, called the Jacobsons organs on the roof of the mouth. Ants also have a well developed sense of taste and can distinguish sour, sweet, bitter and salty taste.

### Smell
Dogs have an excellent sense of smell. A bloodhounds ability to smell helps people to track escaped prisoners or lost children. Bloodhounds can  follow a scent that is nearly four days old. The membrane that detects odours is much bigger and much more sesnsitive in a bloodhounds nose than in a human nose. A male silkworm moth can sniff out a possible mate 11kms away but can not smell anything else. Eel use their sesnse of smell to hunt rather than sight. The ants most highly developed sense is that of smell, which helps it to recognise its nest mates, follow trails laid down by its nest mates and find food. Most birds have a poor sense of smell and taste.

### Touch 
Nocturnal animals tend to have a well developed sense of touch. This sense gives animals information about their surroundings. Animals also use the sense of touch to communicate and find food. Touch receptors are seen in whiskers of cats. A whisker help the cat to find its way in the dark. Mice have long whiskers that can sense an enemy approaching. A birds tongue, palate and bill are most sensitive to the sense of touch. These structures contain nerve endings that respond to touch by sending a signal to the brain.

### Sight
Birds have a keen sense of sight. Their eyes are large and produce large, sharp images especially helpful during flight. Birds of prey have best distance vision in the animal kingdom. A bald eagle can spot a mouse in a feild from high up in the sky. An eagles eyesight is four to eight times sharper than that of a person with perfect vision. Nocturnal creatures have the best night vision. They include cats, mice, bats, owls and moths. They have larger eyes than animals that are active during the day. Their large eyes pick up the faintest light. Most bony fish have good eyesight and can see in colour. Some birds like duck and heron have a transparent membrane that covers the eyes when they dive under water. This allows them to see underwater. Most insects have compund eyes, it helps them to see in all directions at once. Snakes appear to have a fixed stare because their eyes have no lids, instead a transparent protective membrane covers the eye. Snakes do not have very good eyesight but make up for it with an excellent sense of hearing and smell.
