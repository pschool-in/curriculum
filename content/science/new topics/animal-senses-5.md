### Animal Senses
We know that human beings have five sesnses. All animals have similar senses too but most of them have a aparticular sense that is well developed to match their specific survival needs. Moles, that live in the underground where it is dark have little use for good eyesight. They rely on a well developed sense of touch to find food. A spider relies on its eyesight to catch prey. Shark relies on its susperior sesnse of smell to follow the scent of a fish. It can detect even a small amount of blood in a large volume of water.

### Hearing 
A humpback whale communicates with beeps and calls that ssound like a somg. Other whwales can hear the songs miles away. Male humbacks repeat long songs that probably attract females and warn other males to keep away.
