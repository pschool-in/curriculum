### Animal Senses
We know that human beings have five sesnses. All animals have similar senses too but most of them have a aparticular sense that is well developed to match their specific survival needs. Moles, that live in the underground where it is dark have little use for good eyesight. They rely on a well developed sense of touch to find food. A spider relies on its eyesight to catch prey. Shark relies on its susperior sesnse of smell to follow the scent of a fish. It can detect even a small amount of blood in a large volume of water.

### Hearing 
A humpback whale communicates with beeps and calls that ssound like a somg. Other whwales can hear the songs miles away. Male humbacks repeat long songs that probably attract females and warn other males to keep away. Bats and whales find their way around by listening for echoes that bounce off objects. Birds have an acute sense of hearing too. Their ears are small openings in the skull protected by feathers. Birds are able to hear much sharper sounds than humans can. Ants do not have organs of hearing, but they have sensors on their feet and knees to pick up vibrations passing through leaves or the ground. Snakes do not have external ears but their inner ear is well developed . They can hear only low frequency sound or vibrations which travel through the bones to thier inner ear.

### Taste
Butterflies, bees and houseflies taste with their feet. Before, laying eggs on a plant, butterfly walks on the leaf to make sure it is edible for the caterpillar. A fly can feel with mouth parts, its antennae and its feet. A male moths feathery antennae can detect special floating chemicals given off by the female moth even if she is two or three kilometers away. A shark has group of taste buds all around the inside of its mouth and also on the front of its snout. A snakes tongue has no taste buds. The forked tongue is able to collect smells from two places at once and the stronger smell gives the snake a sense of direction. Smells and tastes are then separated in two pits, called the Jacobsons organs on the roof of the mouth. Ants also have a well developed sense of taste and can distinguish sour, sweet, bitter and salty taste.
