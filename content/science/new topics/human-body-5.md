# Objectives
1. To understand  skeletal system and muscular system 

# Grade - 5
### Skeletal  System
The hard parts in our body that we call can feel in our knees and elbows are our bones. There are over 200 bones of different shapes and sizes in our body. They make up the skeleton or the skeletal system which forms the framework of the body. The skeleton mainly consists of the skull, spine or backbone and the ribs. 
Functions:
1.	It gives shape and support to the body.
2.	It helps to keep the organs of the body in their place.
3.	It protects the delicate internal organs of the body.
The place where two bones meet is called a joint. The joint allows you to bend, turn and move different parts of the body. Example: shoulder joint, knee joint.
Drinking milk helps to keep the bones healthy.

### Muscular System
Muscles are the soft part of the body under the skin which helps us to move. There are more than 600 muscles in the body. These muscles form the muscular system.  Muscles and fat form the fleshy covering around the skeleton.
Functions:
1.	Muscles pull at the bones to help the body move.
2.	Bones and muscles together produce movements.
3.	Muscles help the internal organs to work so that they can perform their functions.
Internal organs such as the heart, stomach and lungs have muscles. We can keep our muscles and bones healthy and strong by exercising regularly.  We must also maintain a correct posture while sitting, standing and walking.
