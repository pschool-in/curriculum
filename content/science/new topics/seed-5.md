## Structure of seed - Reading
### Seed
Most plants grow from seeds. Seeds are usually found on inside the fruit. Often new plants grow when seeds from a plant fall on the soil.

### Structure of seed
A thick outer covering called a seed coat protects the seed. The scar on the seed is where it was attached to the fruit. On top of the scar you will find a small hole. This hole allows water to enter the seed.Carefully remove the seed coat. You will see two seed leaves. Between the seed leaves is the baby plant. It has a baby shoot and a baby root. The seed leaves store food for the baby plant. It has a baby shoot and a baby root. The seed leaves store food for the baby plant. They also protect the baby plant. All seeds do not have two seed leaves. Some such as corn, have only one seed leaf.
When seeds get enough water, air and warmth they grow into new plants. They do not grow if any one of these is missing. Seeds use the food stored  in seed leaves to grow. The growth of a baby plant from a seed is called germination. The growing baby plant is known as a seedling. The roots of the young plant start growing from the seed down into the soil. Then the shoot starts appearing and grows upwards. The seed leaves are present till leaves start growing on the plant. Once green leaves grow, the plant is able to make its own food.

## Germination (sorting)
Arrange in the correct order.
```
seed falls on soil, enough water and air, root grow into soil, shoot appears, grow upwards, leaves appear.
```
## Match the following
```
seed coat, protect
seed leaf, food
corn, 1 seed leaf
scar, attached to fruit
```
## Fill in the blanks (drag and drop)
