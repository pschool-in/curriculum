## Moon - Reading
### Conditions on the moon
Moon is devoid of water and hence there is no life on it. Its surface is covered by layers of dust, mountains and craters. There is no wind, clouds and rain as it lacks atmosphere and hence sunlight is also not absorbed or retained. Unlike earth, the moon gets very hot during the day and very cold at night. No sound can be heard on the moon because there is no air and sound cannot travel through a vacuum. The gravitational force of the moon is only one-sixth of that of the earth. On the moon, a person can jump six times higher and weigh one-sixth of his weight, than that on earth.

### Movement of the moon
The earth moves around the sun while the moon moves around the earth. The moon completes one revolution around the earth in 28 days.

### Landing on the moon
The first people to land on the moon were three American astronauts, Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin and Michael Collins on the spacecraft named Apollo 11. Neil Armstrong was the first human to step on the moon and on July 21, 1969. Neil Armstrong walked on the moon along with Edwin Aldrin. 

### Eclipse
The phenomenon occurs when the shadow cast by one celestial body falls on another celestial body.

Solar eclipse: The eclipse occurs when the moon comes in between the earth, casting its shadow on earth, blocking the sunlight. A total solar eclipse occurs when the sun is completely blocked by the moon. A partial solar eclipse occurs when the sun is partially blocked by the moon. Watching an eclipse directly can cause permanent damage to the eyes due to the intense light of the sun.

Lunar eclipse: The eclipse occurs when the earth comes in between the moon and the sun, casting its shadow on the moon. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the shadow of the earth completely covers the moon. A partial lunar eclipse occurs when the shadow of the earth partially covers the moon.
