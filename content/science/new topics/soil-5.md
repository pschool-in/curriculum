### What is a soil profile?
The soil is the topmost layer of the earths surface. It is mainly composed of organic minerals and rock particles that support life. A soil profile is a vertical cross-section of the soil. The different layers seen in a soil profile are called as soil horizons.

### Soil Profile
There are three different layers in soil namely, topsoil, subsoil and parent rock.
Topsoil: It is the top most layer and is composed of dried leaves, grasses, dead leaves, small rocks, twigs, surface organisms, fallen trees and decomposed organic matter. It is often black or dark brown in colour due to the presence of organic matter in the form of humus.
