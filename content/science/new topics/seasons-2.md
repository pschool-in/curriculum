### Seasons - Reading
One day, the seasons had an argument. Each one of them said, “I am the best!”

Spring said, “I am when flowers bloom and there is greenery every where. The sweet scent of the flowers and melodies of birds are spread everywhere.”

Summer said, “Yes, but I am when the sun shines brightly. It feel so hot that everyone takes rest and enjoys with lots of icecream, cold drinks and delicious watermelon."

Rain said, “I am when there is puddles everywhere and kids enjoy playing in the rain.”

Winter said, “I am when people wear sweaters, caps, gloves and scarfs to keep them warm.”

Since they couldn’t decide who was best, they agreed that they were all important because one could not do without the other.
