## Reading

### How do we know water is everywhere?

Apart from the water bodies like rivers, lakes and seas, there's plenty of water around us that we don't notice. For example, tears, saliva, water running from our nose, blood, lemon juice, juicy fruits, cucumber, tomato and many other things.

### Why do we feel thirsty?

Our body is 70% made of water. Its doesn't mean that it has flowing water within. It means that 70% functioning of our body is dedpendent on water. For example;
1. Water keeps our blood thin.
2. It helps to digest our food.
3. Urination of waste materials.
Thereforer, we must have sufficient water in our body for tthe esy performance of these functions. In case there's not enough water, we feel thirsty.

### Fun Fact!

There are some plants like Bulrushes, Lotus, Water chestnut, Hyacinth and Spider plant that grow only in water. If we try to grow them in soil, they simply don't.
