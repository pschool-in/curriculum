# Chapter maha g3- Our need For Water

## Reading

### How do we know water is everywhere?

Apart from the water bodies like rivers, lakes and seas, there's plenty of water around us that we don't notice. For example, tears, saliva, water running from our nose, blood, lemon juice, juicy fruits, cucumber, tomato and many other things.

### Why do we feel thirsty?

Our body is 70% made of water. Its doesn't mean that it has flowing water within. It means that 70% functioning of our body is dedpendent on water. For example;
1. Water keeps our blood thin.
2. It helps to digest our food.
3. Urination of waste materials.
Thereforer, we must have sufficient water in our body for tthe esy performance of these functions. In case there's not enough water, we feel thirsty.

### Fun Fact!

There are some plants like Bulrushes, Lotus, Water chestnut, Hyacinth and Spider plant that grow only in water. If we try to grow them in soil, they simply don't.

# Chapter maha g3: Where does water come from?

## Reading

### Where does water come from?

Simply put, it comes from THE RAIN. 

Rain water leads to rise in rivulets, streams and rivers. 

Still water forms lakes and ponds.

Some water gets deposited under the ground and we usually extract it through wells, hand-pumps and bore-wells.

### Fun fact!

1. Dams are built to slower the flow of water, to save it and to generate energy.

2. Rainwater harvesting is another good technique for conserving water in which the rainwater is collected from he roofs of the house and gets deposited in the tank.

### How rivers are formed?

When rain falls on the mountains, water flows down. Further, many rivulets combine to form a river.

### Which of these sources of water are natural and which ones are man-made? (Drag and drop)

```
Man-made: wells, dams, bore-wells, hand-pumps, canals, taps, reservoirs.

Natural: springs, streams, rivers, lakes, creeks, seas, oceans, ponds.
```

### Fun fact!

1. Pure water has no shape, colour, taste or smell and is transparent.

### New words!

1. Transparent: Something that you can see through.

2. Transluscent: Something you can partially see through.

3. Opaque: Something you cannot see through.

### 3 stages of water

Solid: At cold places in the form of ice and snow.

Liquid: The flowing state of water and the most commonly used one.

Gas/ Vapour: Formed at high temperatures.

## Activites
