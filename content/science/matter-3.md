### States of Matter

We can see a number of things around you. Everything we can see and touch is made up of matter. Anything that occupies space and has mass is called matter.

### What is Mass?

Mass is a measure of how much matter is present in an object. The air we breathe, the food we take, and the water we drink, all have matter in them.

### What is Volume?

The space occupied by an object is called its volume.

### Three states of Matter

Solid, liquid and gas are the three states of matter. 

Solid has fixed shape and fixed volume. eg: pencil, bat, bag, apple, stone, book

Liquid does not have fixed shape. It takes the shape of it container.eg: milk, honey, water, juice, oil, petrol

Gas does not have fixed shape and volume. eg: cloud, smoke, gas cylinder (LPG), spray, water vapour, wind

## Multiple Choice Questions

```
Volume is the ______ occupied by an object.
space, mass, weight, matter

How many states of matters are there?
three, four, five, two

Which of the following has volume but does not have shape?
liquid, solid, gas

Which of the following does not have volume and shape?
gas, liquid, solid

The amount of matter present in an object is measured by _______.
mass, volume, space, state of matter
```

## Liquid vs Gas 

Classify the below as liquid and gas.

Liquid - honey, water, juice, oil

Gas - cloud, smoke, LPG, spray, water vapour, wind

## True or False

```
True:
Everything we can see is made up of matter.
Gas has no fixed volume.
Cloud is a form of gas.

False:
Gas has no mass.
The space occupied by an object is called mass.
```

## Match

Match the related ones.

```
space occupied, volume
total matter, mass
no volume, gas
drink, liquid
fixed shape, solid
```

## Drag and Drop

Drag and drop the words at proper place.

```
*Mass* is a measure of how much matter is in an object.
*Volume* is the space occupied by an object.
*Liquid* has no fixed shape but has fixed volume.
*Smoke* is a gas.
*Gas* has no fixed shape and no fixed volume.
```



## Change in States of Matter

Matters change their state as the temparature changes. Solid changes to liquid and liquid changes into gas on heating. Gas becomes liquid and liquid becomes solid on cooling.

### Melting
 
Change of solid into liquid on heating is called melting. For example, if ice (solid) is heated, it will change into water (liquid).
 
### Evaporation
 
Change of liquid into vapour on heating is called Evaporation. For example, if water is heated, it will change into steam.
  
### Freezing

Change of liquid into solid on cooling is known as freezing. For example, water (liquid) poured in ice-tray and placed in the freezer (fridge), gets cooled and becomes ice (solid).

### Condensation

Change of gas into liquid on cooling is called condensation. For example; clouds (gas) on cooling condense and fall as rain (liquid)

### Experiment

Take a balance. Keep an air filled football in one plate and an empty football in another plate . What happens? 
Air filled ball goes down. It is because air has mass.

## Drag and Drop

Drag and drop the words at proper place.

```
*Water* from ocean and rivers *evaporate* and form clouds.
Clouds are in *gas* state. They get cooled by breeze and fall as *rain*.
If we put water in *freezer*, it becomes *ice*.
```

## Multiple Choice Questions - 2

```
Solid becomes ______ on heating.
liquid, gas, water vapour, water

Change of solid into liquid on heating is called ______.
melting, evaporation, freezing

Change of gas into liquid on cooling is called ______.
condensation, freezing, evaporation

Water becomes _____ on heating.
water vapour, cloud, atmosphere

Change of liquid into solid on cooling is called ______.
freezing, evaporation, melting
```

## True or False

```
True:
Change of liquid to gas is called evaporation.
When ice is heated, it becomes water.
Change of gas into liquid on cooling is called condensation.

False:
Water is commonly avaiable in gas form.
Metals like gold, iron cannot be melted.
```


## Fuel

Paper, firewood, dried leaves and charcoal can be burnt. Liquids like kerosene, petrol and diesel also burn on heating. Domestic gas burns and helps in cooking.

Substances when burnt give out heat. But in some substances, the heat released is very low. Thus, these are not used for heating purpose.

Substances that give out more heat while burning are used for heating purpose.

These substances are called fuels.

Electrical energy is also used as fuel for cooking and transporting.

## Multiple Choice Questions

```
Gas has ______.
mass, shape, volume

_____ is used for heating and preparing food.
Fuel,  Paper, Gas

______ energy is also used as fuel.
Electrical, Magnetic, Glucose

______ is the common fuel used in cars.
Petrol, Charcoal, Firewood, LPG

______ is the common fuel used in cooking.
LPG, Petrol, Paper

LPG stands for _____
Liquid Petroleum Gas, Light Petrol Gas, Liquid Petrol Gas
```

## True or False

```
True:
Domestic gas (LPG) helps in cooking.
Water does not catch fire.
Fuels are mainly used for cooking and transportation.

False:
Electrical energy cannot be used as fuel.
All solid matters can be used as a fuel.
```

## Drag and Drop

Drag and drop the words at proper place.

```
Cars run on *petrol*.
*LPG* is used for cooking.
Oven uses *electrical* energy.
Substances that give lot of heat on burning is called *fuel*.
*Kerosene* is the liquid fuel commonly used for cooking.
```

## Drag and Drop
