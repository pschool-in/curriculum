### States of Matter

We can see a number of things around you. Everything we can see and touch is made up of matter. Anything that occupies space and has mass is called matter.

### What is Mass?

Mass is a measure of how much matter is present in an object. The air we breathe, the food we take, and the water we drink, all have matter in them.

### What is Volume?
The space occupied by an object is called its volume.

### Three states of Matter

Solid, liquid and gas are the three states of matter. 

Solid has fixed shape and fixed volume. eg: pencil, bat, bag, apple, stone, book

Liquid does not have fixed shape. It takes the shape of it container.eg: milk, honey, water, juice, oil, petrol

Gas does not have fixed shape and volume. eg: cloud, smoke, gas cylinder (LPG), spray, water vapour, wind
