# Chapter - maha g3: Our Clothes

## Reading 

### Why do we need clothes?

a. To cover our body.

b. To protect ourselves from dust and dirt.

c. To feel warm during winters.

d. To not tan from sunlight.

e. To look presentable.

...what else can you think of?
    
### How do we know what to wear?

There are three main seasons, namely, The Summer, The Winter and The Rainy Season. These seasons last for almost 4 months and after the completion of one cycle, they continue to follow each other. That’s why it’s called “cycle of seasons”.
So, we can say that what we wear depends on the cycle of seasons.

In addition to this, we wear clothes of different designs, colors and tradition. So we can say that clothing style also depends on occupation, taste and occasion.
