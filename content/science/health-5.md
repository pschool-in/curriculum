## Infectious Diseases and Prevention - Reading

### Infectious Diseases
One has to take care to stay away from people who are ill with the flu (influenza), cold, ringworm, scabies, chickenpox. These diseases spread from one person to the other. Such diseases are called infectious diseases.

They are caused by micro-organisms. Every infectious disease is caused by a specific micro-organism or germ. When the germs of a particular disease enter the body and begin to grow, the person gets the disease.

### Spread of infectious diseases
When a person has a cold, the germs from his body spread in the air when he coughs or sneezes. When these germs enter other people’s bodies, they can also get the disease. That is, the disease spreads. Typhoid spreads when its germs are passed on by a person ill with typhoid to another person.

Infections can be spread through air, water, food or insects.

### Spread of disease through air
The germs of a disease like influenza are present in the spit or saliva of the person who has the disease. When the person coughs or spits they enter the air with tiny droplets of saliva or spit. When other people breathe in that same air, the germs enter their bodies. Diseases of the throat and the chest spread through the air, for example, a cold and cough, tuberculosis, swine flu, etc. That is why we are told to cover our nose and mouth when we cough or sneeze.

### Spread of disease through water
The germs of diseases of the intestines like typhoid, cholera, diarrhea as also of jaundice, are present in the feces of the affected person. If the feces get mixed with water the germs in it also enter the water. If another person drinks water that has been contaminated by these germs, they enter his intestines too, and that person can get the disease. To prevent the spread of disease in this manner, it is best to avoid washing clothes and bathing in the water sources or defecating on the banks of the water.

### Spread of disease through food
Several people get diarrhea after consuming contaminated food. Diseases spread through food also. This is also called food poisoning. When flies sit on the feces of a person who has an intestinal disease, the germs of the disease stick to their legs. When the same flies sit on our food, the germs enter the food. If we eat that food, the germs enter our body and we can get the disease. That is why it is important to always keep our food covered. Food is handled while preparing or serving it. If someone who has an intestinal disease handles or serves food without washing his hands properly, the germs sticking to his hands can enter the food. Food contaminated in this way can also cause disease. One must avoid eating it. Maintaining cleanliness everywhere is beneficial for our health.

### The spread of disease by insects
You may be aware that one can get malaria from the bite of a certain kind of mosquito. When this type of mosquito bites someone who has malaria, the malaria germs in that person’s blood enter the mosquito’s body with the blood it sucks. If this mosquito bites another person, the malaria germs enter that person’s body too and he too can get malaria. Insects like mosquitoes, lice and fleas spread disease. That is why we must stop such insects from breeding.

### Spread of disease by direct contact
Ringworm, scabies are diseases that affect the skin. Their germs are found on the skin. If someone else comes in contact with the skin of a person having this disease or wears his clothes then that person can get that skin disease too. That is why it is better to avoid sharing clothes.

### An epidemic of a disease
Germs of diseases like the flu or conjunctivitis spread quickly through the air. So, many people can get such diseases all at one time. If the water of a common source is contaminated by germs of a disease like cholera, then there is the danger of all those who drink that water getting the disease. If at someplace, mosquitoes breed in large numbers then many people there can get malaria. When many people in one area get the same infectious disease all at the same time, we say that there is an epidemic of the disease.

### Prevention of infectious diseases
1. To prevent diseases from spreading through water, it is purified at the waterworks. 
2. In smaller towns and villages, bleaching powder is added to community sources of water to kill the germs and make the water safe for drinking. 
3. When there is an epidemic of gastro or jaundice, people are advised to boil water before drinking it.
4. To prevent mosquitoes from breeding, we must ensure there is no stagnant water in the surroundings. But, if that is not possible, insecticides have to be used. Thus diseases like malaria can be prevented.
5. People who have a serious infectious disease like tuberculosis or swine flu are quarantined. There are separate wards in hospitals for people with infectious diseases. Clothes and utensils used by the patients are washed with germicides. The spittle of a person who has tuberculosis is collected in a vessel and covered with a germicide-like phenyl. Such precautions help to prevent the disease from spreading to others.
6. To prevent the spread of diseases through the air, people should cover the mouth when sneezing or coughing and avoid spitting in the open. If it is necessary to be with such a patient, a mask should be worn to cover the nose and mouth.
7. If someone in the family gets an infectious disease, the government health department should be informed so that necessary steps for preventing the spread of the disease can be taken.

### Vaccination
When disease-producing micro-organisms enter our body, the body resists the disease or fights the germs. That is why many times we do not get a disease even if germs enter our body.

Another way to prevent disease is vaccination. Our body develops resistance to a particular disease due to vaccination. Soon after a baby is born, she is given the tuberculosis vaccine. When the baby is one and a half months old, she is given vaccinations against diphtheria, whooping
cough, tetanus and polio. Two more doses of these vaccinations are given at intervals of one month.

The vaccines for diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus are combined into a triple vaccine and given as an injection. The polio vaccine is given orally.
 
### Public health service facilities
To prevent the spread of infectious diseases and epidemics, health and
community welfare programs are undertaken at the national level.
Community programs for vaccination are also undertaken as part of
national health schemes. Children are given the vaccines by trained people. Special camps are arranged for this purpose. Primary Health Centres have been established at the village level. There are also facilities like mobile dispensaries, ambulances and a Welfare Fund for the
disabled. Services like the examination of urine and blood, X-ray, ultra-sound and other scans are also available through the health programs. Thus, patients can get the service they need without delay. 

People are also educated about the right methods of handling drinking water and food. They are urged to maintain cleanliness in their surroundings. It is now forbidden by law to spit in a public place. The purpose of this ban is to prevent the spread of diseases. Mass media are also used for raising public awareness about health and hygiene issues.
