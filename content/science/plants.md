## PLANTS
Plants are an important part of nature. They can survive on land and in water. Plants gives us food, fresh air, medicines, wood etc. The main parts of the plants are roots, stem, leaves, flowers, vegetables and fruits. We are using most parts of a plant for various purposes. 

**LEAVES**

Leaf is a flattened structure of plant which is usually green in colour and it is attached to the stem. Leaves are of different shapes, sizes, colours and textures.

**FLOWERS**

Flowers are the most attractive part of a plant. They also have different structures, colours and fragrance. Some of the common flowers are jasmine, rose, lotus, sunflower, hibiscus etc. 

**VEGETABLES**

Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. Some vegetables grow underground like potatoes, some are leaf vegetables like spinach, some are developed from flowers like brinjal, etc. Vegetables are of different colours, shapes and sizes. 

**FRUITS**

A fruit is the part of a flowering plant that contains the seeds. Some are juicy and some are fleshy. They are of different colours and tastes. Fruits keeps us healthy.

## PLANTS

A plant has two organ systems: 1) the shoot system, and 2) the root system. Root system is the part of the plant that grows below the ground and the part of the plant that grows above the ground is called the shoot system. The shoot system comprises of the stem, leaf, flower and fruit.

Plants not only gives us food but also medicines, shade, fresh air, etc. Each part of the plant serves many purposes.

## PLANTS

Like our body a plant also has many parts. The main parts of a plant include root, stem, leaf, flower, fruit and seed. Each part has a set of jobs to do to keep the plant healthy.

Roots are found below the soil and it holds the plant firmly in its position. It absorbs the water and minerals from the soil. Sometimes it also stores food. Roots are of two main types: tap root and ﬁbrous root. 

The stem is the part that stays above the ground. A stem usually bears leaves, flowers and fruits. It distributes the water and minerals  from the root to the leaves and flowers. The stem is the support system of the plant.

The leaves grow out of the side of the stem. Their main function is to make food for the plant by the process known as photosynthesis.
Also they help in removing any excess water via stomata and this process is known as transpiration.

Flowers are the reproductive part of a plant. The flower has both female parts, called the pistil, and male parts, called the staemens. They work together to fertilize the plant and produce seeds.

The fruit is a fleshy or dry ripened part of a plant, enclosing the seed or seeds.

The hard part inside the fruit is called seed. Most plants grow from seeds.

## PLANTS

All living things need food. Photosynthesis is a process by which plants make their food using chlorophyll, water, carbon dioxide in the presence of sunlight.Plants are also referred as primary producers since they prepare food for themselves.
Stems and branches of the plant take the prepared food from the leaves to other parts of the plants. Extra food is stored as starch in roots, stems, leaves ,fruits and in flowers.


Plants are classiﬁed in many ways based on stems, life span, seeds, ﬂower and colour.
Based on the production of flowers, plants are classified into flowering and nonflowering plants.
Based on the period of life cycle plants are classified into Annuals, Biennials and Perennials.  
Based on the colour present in the plant, they are classified into Green and Nongreen plants.

# GRADE 5

**REPRODUCTION IN PLANTS**

Reproduction is the process by which living things make young ones. There are two kinds of reproduction that take place in plants.
They are sexual reproduction (reproduction through seeds) and asexual reproduction (reproduction through different parts of plants).

The main stages involved in sexual reproduction are as follows.
Pollination- The transfer of pollen grains from the anther to stigma of a flower.
Fertilization- When pollination is successful, the pollen joins the egg present in the ovary. The cell which results after fusion is called a zygote.
Seed formation- After fertilization, the ovary swells and changes into a fruit. The seeds develop from the ovules.

Flowers are not required for asexual reproduction method. It occurs through budding, fragmentation, vegetative propagation, and spore formation.

**AGRICULTURE**

Agriculture or farming is one of the main sources of the livelihood. It is the practice of farming to grow crops and produce food.  Major agricultural products are cereals, vegetables, fruits and oil seeds. They are cultivated not only for our basic needs but also for commercial purpose. In agriculture, there are certain parameters to be considered such as the type of crop, properties of soil, climate etc.

Soil is one of the most important natural resources and is essential for agriculture. The organic and inorganic material on the surface of the earth that provides the medium for plant growth is called the soil. The soil is classified on the basis of the proportion of various sizes.

 ********************************************************************************************************************************
Soil is one of the most important natural resources. It is essential for agriculture. It supports the growth of plants by holding the roots and supplying water and nutrients. It is the home for many organisms. Soil is formed by the breaking of rocks by the action of wind, water and climate. The mixture of rock particles and humus is called the soil. The soil is classified on the basis of the proportion of various sizes.
