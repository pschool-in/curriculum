## AIR

## Chapter: tn-5-3-science: Air

### Atmosphere

Atmosphere is the layer of gas that surrounds Earth. Atmosphere is divided into five different layers:
  1. Troposphere: It is the lowest layer of atmosphere. It extends up to 10km from sea. It is the densest layer.
  2. Stratosphere: It is the region above troposphere. It extends up to 50km. There is no water vapour in this layer. The temperature is around -500C.
  3. Mesosphere: It is the region above stratosphere. It extends to a height of about 85km. The temperature is around -1100C. most of the meteors burn in this layer.
  4. Thermosphere: It is very rare layer of air above mesosphere.
  5. Exosphere: It is the outermost layer with extremely thin air. It extends up to 400 to 1500km.

### Importance of Air
  1. All living organisms require air.
  2. It is required for maintaining the water cycle.
  3. Air supplies energy.
  4. Sound travels through air.
  5. Plants require air to grow.
  6. Helps in transport.
  7. Produce wind energy
  8. Help in movement of parachutes and hot air balloons.

### Airborne Diseases

Diseases which are caused by microorganisms and communicated through air are called airborne diseases. Air borne disease can be further classified into two.

  1. Bacterial diseases: Diphtheria, Whooping Cough and Tuberclosis are some of the common airborne diseases caused by bacteria.
  2. Viral diseases: Common cold, influenza, measles, mumps and chickenpox are some of the diseases caused by virus.

### Prevention:
  1. Avoid close contact with people who have active symptoms of disease.
  2. Maintain personal hygiene.
  3. Keep the patient in complete isolation.Cover nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing.
  4. Avoid touching the face or other people with unwashed hands.
  5. Wash your hands thoroughly.
  6. Timely vaccination can prevent the diseases.
