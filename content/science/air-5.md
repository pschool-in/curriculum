## AIR

## Chapter: tn-5-3-science: Air

### Atmosphere

Atmosphere is the layer of gas that surrounds Earth. Atmosphere is divided into five different layers:
  1. Troposphere: It is the lowest layer of atmosphere. It extends up to 10km from sea. It is the densest layer.
  2. Stratosphere: It is the region above troposphere. It extends up to 50km. There is no water vapour in this layer. The temperature is around -500C.
  3. Mesosphere: It is the region above stratosphere. It extends to a height of about 85km. The temperature is around -1100C. most of the meteors burn in this layer.
  4. Thermosphere: It is very rare layer of air above mesosphere.
  5. Exosphere: It is the outermost layer with extremely thin air. It extends up to 400 to 1500km.

### Importance of Air
  1. All living organisms require air.
  2. It is required for maintaining the water cycle.
  3. Air supplies energy.
  4. Sound travels through air.
  5. Plants require air to grow.
  6. Helps in transport.
  7. Produce wind energy
  8. Help in movement of parachutes and hot air balloons.

### True or False

Classify sentences as true or false.
```

```

### Air Pollution

Presence of harmful substances in air have an  adverse effect on living beings and environment. This is called air pollution.

### Causes:
  1. Industries
  2. Burning of fossil fuels
  3. Agricultural activities like use of pesticides
  4. Mining 
  5. Use of chemical for cleaning

### Effects:
  1. Spread of diseases
  2. Global warming
  3. Acid rain
  4. Depletion of ozone layer
  5. Adverse effect on marine life
  6. Adverse effect on wildlife

### Prevention:
  1. Use public transport
  2. Reduce usage of fossil fuels
  3. Use renewable energy sources
  4. Recycle and reuse
  5. Switch off appliances after using them
  6. Plant more trees

## Cause or Effect(classify sentence)

```
## Choose the correct option (fill up- using options)

Choose the correct option from the following.

```
Combustion of fossil fuels like coal and petroleum release *sulphur dioxide (carbon dioxide)*
Air pollution can be natural or *man-made (artificial)*.
Extraction of *minerals (salts)* from the earth is called mining.
Taj Mahal in Agra is built entirely with *white (yellow)* marbles.
Air pollutants cause pneumonia and *asthma (cold)* in children.
The growth of *green (red)* algae in water bodies is called eutrophication.

```
## Group: Natural vs Man-made

Classify the following based on whether it is natural or man-made pollution
```
Natural: volcanic eruption, lightning, storm
Man-made: mining, industrial waste, burning coal
```
### Airborne Diseases

Diseases which are caused by microorganisms and communicated through air are called airborne diseases. Air borne disease can be further classified into two.

  1. Bacterial diseases: Diphtheria, Whooping Cough and Tuberclosis are some of the common airborne diseases caused by bacteria.
  2. Viral diseases: Common cold, influenza, measles, mumps and chickenpox are some of the diseases caused by virus.

### Prevention:
  1. Avoid close contact with people who have active symptoms of disease.
  2. Maintain personal hygiene.
  3. Keep the patient in complete isolation.Cover nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing.
  4. Avoid touching the face or other people with unwashed hands.
  5. Wash your hands thoroughly.
  6. Timely vaccination can prevent the diseases.
