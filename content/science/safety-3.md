### Child Safety

Childline service was established across India and was established under the Ministry of Women and Child Development. It is first established as a project in the year 1996. Child-line was organized to help children under age 18 years. In India, many children under 18-year-old are still working as labour. They are employed in places like construction, cracker workshop, and other small-scale working places. Teaching a child about a certain profession isn’t bad, but making the child work for money and outsourcing their labour to someone else for money is called child-labor. The National Child Labour Projects (NCLP) was established to rehab child labour. Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) is a government program for early childhood care & development. The prohibition of the child marriage act is established to prevent child marriage. The Indian penal code 1860 is for punishing the people involved in child trafficking.
