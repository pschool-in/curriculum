## Chapter: maha g5: Busy at work - our internal organs.

### Organ system.

1. A group of organs that together carry out some function of the body is called a system.
2. The nose, trachea, lungs and diaphragm are organs of the respiratory system.
3. The mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and anus and certain glands outside the alimentary canal are the organs of the digestive system.
4. Other systems like the circulatory system, the skeletal system, the excretory system also take care of other important functions of our body.
5. The nervous system co-ordinates all the functions of the body.
6. For us to lead a healthy life, all our systems must function smoothly.

## Digestion-1 (drag and drop)
```
The process of digestion *begins* as soon as food is taken into the mouth.
The teeth, tongue and *saliva* all help to convert food into a soft moist ball called a *bolus*.
The bolus passes through the *oesophagus* into the stomach.
The *stomach* is shaped like a bag.
The food is *churned* in the stomach. 
The digestive *juices* in the stomach bring about some digestive processes.  
```
## Small intestine (drag and drop)
```
The food changes into a thin *slurry* in the stomach. 
Then it passes into the *small* intestine.
The small intestine of an adult is about *7* metres long. 
The digestive juices in the *intestine* bring about several digestive processes.  
In the small intestine, they are absorbed into the *blood*. 
The remaining substances pass into the *large* intestine.
```
## Large intestine (drag and drop)
```
The large intestine of an adult is about *one* and a half metres long. 
Here, much of the *water* in the remaining substances is absorbed into the body.
The *faeces* collect in the rectum for some time. 
Later, they are expelled from the body through the *anus*. 
```
## Alimentary canal (drag and drop)
```
*Digestion* takes place in different parts of a long and flexible tube called the *alimentary* canal. 
The upper end of this tube is the *mouth* and the lower end is called the *anus*.
The *shape* of this tube is not the same in all its parts.
```
## Respiration (drag and drop)
```
When we inhale, the air from outside goes into the trachea and through its branches, into the *lungs*.
In the lungs, these *branches* divide further into smaller and smaller branches. 
At the end of the last branches, there are air sacs or *alveoli*.
Between the thoracic cavity and the abdominal cavity, there is an organ like a flexible sheet called the *diaphragm*.
When the diaphragm moves *downward*, we breathe in.
When the diaphragm moves *upwards*,air in the lungs is pushed out.
```
## Exchange of gases. (drag and drop)
```
When the outside air reaches the alveoli, the *oxygen* in it passes into the thin *blood* vessels.
The *carbon dioxide* that is brought by the blood from all parts of the body enters the *air* in the alveoli. 
When we *exhale*, the carbon dioxide is also given out with the air.
```
## Nervous System (drag and drop)
```
There is a *network* that connects the brain with all the different
parts of the body. 
This is a network of *nerves* that carry messages to and fro between the brain and the parts of the body.
The brain and the network of nerves are together called the *nervous* system. 
The nervous system functions to *co-ordinate* all our bodily functions.
```

## Fill in the blanks (using options)
```
A sufficient quantity of *water (energy)* is necessary for the processes of digestion to take place properly.
The inner lining of the respiratory organs has fine hairlike structures called *cilia (villi)*.
The *skeletal (nervous)* system gives support and shape to the body and protects the important organs inside it.
The *excretory (respiratory)* system expels the waste substances that are formed in the body.
If one keeps drinking alcohol for a long period of time, it causes *ulcers (cyst)* on the inner lining of the digestive organs.
```

## Human Body

## Chapter: tn-5-1-science: Organ Systems

### Digestive system

The process of conversion of complex food molecules into simpler molecules is called digestion. The digestive system can be divided into two.
1. Digestive tract 
2. Digestive glands

### Respiratory system

The respiratory system provides oxygen to the tissues of the body and
removes carbon dioxide from the tissues. There are three major parts forming the respiratory system.

1. Airway 
2. Lungs 
3. Muscles of respiration

### Circulatory system

In this system blood is circulated to transport oxygen and nutrients to every part of the body. Circulatory system consists of the following:
1. Heart 
2. Blood vessels 
3. Blood

### Excretory system

Excretory system removes the waste products from the body. It also
regulates water and electrolyte balance. Kidneys, lungs, liver and skin together function as excretory organs. Excretory system consists of the following.
1. Kidneys 
2. Ureters 
3. Urinary bladder

### Nervous system
Nervous system is an integration of nerves and they are composed of specialized cells called Neurons. The human nervous system is divided into the following.
1. Central Nervous System (CNS)
2. Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
