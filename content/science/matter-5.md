### Matter and Materials

Our needs have increased in the modern days and we use number of things in our daily life. We get some of them from the nature and some other things are manufactured artificially. The things you use like pen, pencil, ink, eraser, note book, ball and the food you eat, all have different nature and characteristics. They are obtained by transforming the natural and artificial substances.

We know, matter can exist in three physical states: solid, liquid and gas. It is made up of molecules and the molecules are made up of atoms.

In solids, molecules are very closely arranged. Solids are incompressible. They have definite shape, size and volume.

In liquids, molecules are loosely packed. Hence, liquids are semi compressible. They have definite volume, but no definite shape and size.

In gases, molecules are very loosely packed. Hence, gases are highly compressible.

A material is a mixture of substances that constitute an object. They can be pure or impure, natural or man made. Materials are needed to get the things needed for our daily life. We need food, dress and many other goods for our daily living. Natural and man made materials are transformed to produce these things.

### Household Goods

These are the products that we use in our house permanently. The goods that are found in a house permanently are called household goods. House hold goods are: furniture, kitchenware, cloths, towels, beddings, boots and electronic goods.

### Sinking and Floating

You could have seen that some objects float in water while others sink. Whether an object floats or sinks is determined by its density. When an object is immersed into a liquid, the liquid exerts an upward force on the object. It is known as upthrust. What happens if you put a coin and an empty water bottle in water? The weight of the coin is greater than the upthrust and so the coin sinks. But weight of the empty water bottle is less and so it floats.

### Solubility in Water

Some substances completely dissolve in water. We say that these substances are soluble in water. Other substances do not dissolve in water even after we stir for long time. These substances are insoluble in water.

### Experiment

Take a small cup of water and add a small amount of salt. Stir it with a spoon. Check whether salt is soluable in water. Repeat the same experiment with sugar, saw dust and sand.

### Mixing of liquids

Certain liquids are heavier (dense) than other liquids. When you attempt to mix liquids which have different densities they separate when you stop mixing them.

The heavier liquid deposits at the bottom and the lighter liquid floats on the top. For example, oil and water do not mix together.
