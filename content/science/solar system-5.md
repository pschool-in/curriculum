## Our Earth and Our Solar System- Reading

### Heavenly Bodies
When we look up from an open ground, we see the sky. In a clear night sky, we can see many stars. They are very far away from the earth. The sun and the moon are comparatively close to the earth. So, we can see their round shapes. The sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, etc are all known as heavenly bodies.

### Stars
The heavenly bodies that twinkle are called stars. Stars have their
own light. The sun is a star. It is closer to us than any of the other stars. Hence, it appears big and brilliant. In its bright light, during the
day, we cannot see other stars.

### Planets
The heavenly bodies that do not twinkle are called planets. Planets do
not have light of their own. They get light from the stars. Planets revolve around a star, even as they rotate around themselves.

### Solar System
Our earth is a planet. It gets its light from the sun. It moves around the sun. Its movement around the sun is called the revolution of
the earth. Besides earth, seven other planets revolve around the sun. They are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Every planet in the solar system revolves around the sun along a specific path. This path is known as that planetâ€™s orbit. The sun, which is a star, and the planets that revolve around it are together called the solar system. Besides the planets, the solar system also includes various other heavenly bodies.
