## Our Earth and Our Solar System- Reading

### Heavenly Bodies
When we look up from an open ground, we see the sky. In a clear night sky, we can see many stars. They are very far away from the earth. The sun and the moon are comparatively close to the earth. So, we can see their round shapes. The sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, etc are all known as heavenly bodies.

### Stars
The heavenly bodies that twinkle are called stars. Stars have their
own light. The sun is a star. It is closer to us than any of the other stars. Hence, it appears big and brilliant. In its bright light, during the
day, we cannot see other stars.

### Planets
The heavenly bodies that do not twinkle are called planets. Planets do
not have light of their own. They get light from the stars. Planets revolve around a star, even as they rotate around themselves.

### Solar System
Our earth is a planet. It gets its light from the sun. It moves around the sun. Its movement around the sun is called the revolution of
the earth. Besides earth, seven other planets revolve around the sun. They are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Every planet in the solar system revolves around the sun along a specific path. This path is known as that planet’s orbit. The sun, which is a star, and the planets that revolve around it are together called the solar system. Besides the planets, the solar system also includes various other heavenly bodies.



## Fill in the Blanks (using options)

```
The sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, etc are all known as *heavenly (heavy)*bodies.
*Stars (Planets)* have their own light.
The *sun (earth)* is a star.
*Planets (Stars)* do not have light of their own.
Planets *revolve (rotate)* around a star, even as they *rotate (revolve)* around themselves.
```

## True or False

```
True:
Besides earth, seven other planets revolve around the sun. 
The heavenly bodies that twinkle are called stars. 
The heavenly bodies that do not twinkle are called planets.

False:
Our earth is not a planet.
Every planet in the solar system rotates around the sun along a specific path.

```

## Name the following. (drag and drop)

```
A heavenly body that twinkles - *stars*
A heavenly body that does not twinkle - *planets*
A specific path around the sun along which a planet revolves around the sun - *orbit*
A star close to the earth - *sun*

```
## Fill in the blanks. (drag and drop)

``` 
Earth's movement around the sun is called *revolution*.
Every planet in the solar system revolves around the sun in a specific path called *orbit*.
In the sun's bright light we cannot see the other *stars* during the day.
*Planets* do not have light of their own.
Planets *rotate* around themselves.
```
### Satelites
Some heavenly bodies revolve around planets. These are called satellites. Satellites too get their light from the sun. We see the moon at night. It revolves around the earth. Hence, it is called a satellite of the earth. The planets revolve around the sun along with their satellites.

### Man - made Satellites
Man-made satellites provide useful information foragriculture, environment, weather forecasting, making maps, and searching for water and mineral wealth on the earth. They are also used for telecommunication. They are put into orbit around the earth. They can remain in space for many years.

### Dwarf Planets
Some smaller heavenly bodies revolve around the sun. They are called dwarf planets. Of these, the most well-known is Pluto. Dwarf planets revolve independently around the sun. They have an orbit of their own.

### Asteroids
Between the planets Mars and Jupiter, there is a band of numerous small heavenly bodies. They are called asteroids. Asteroids also revolve around the sun. Compared to the sun, other heavenly bodies in the solar system are much smaller. The moon is closest to the earth. That is why, it appears to be so big although it is smaller than the sun.

The planets, satellites, dwarf planets and asteroids are all part of the solar system.

### Gravity
All heavenly bodies exert a force of attraction or a pull on one another. This force is called the force of gravity. The sun exerts a gravitational pull on all planets whereas the planets tend to move away from the sun. As a result of these two forces, a planet keeps revolving around the sun at a fixed distance in a fixed orbit. In the same way, satellites revolve around their planets. 

Due to the earth’s gravity, all things on the earth remain on it. Even if we throw something upwards with great force, it finally falls to the ground.

## Group: Man-made Vs Natural
Classify the following as natural or man-made satellites.
```
Man-made: Sputnik, Aryabhatta, Skylab
Natural: Moon, Titan
```

## Multiple Choice Question

```
The band of asteroids is seen between which planets?
Mars and Jupiter, Earth and Mars, Mercury and Earth

Which of these is a dwarf planet?
Pluto, Mars, Neptune, Venus
 
Where do satellites get their light from?
sun, moon, planets

What are the heavenly bodies that revolve around the planets?
satellites, sun, earth 

What are man-made satellites used for?
*telecommunication, *weather forecasting, *making maps, none of the above

```
### Space
The emptiness between and beyond the stars and planets is called space or outer space.

### Rocket technology
People have always been curious about the heavenly bodies in the sky. They have always wanted to reach them. However, to send some object from the earth into space, it must be given power against the force of gravity. Rocket technology or space launch technology is used for that purpose.

Very powerful rockets are used to send a spacecraft into space. A tremendous quantity of fuel is burnt in rockets so that spacecraft weighing thousands of tons can be launched into space. In the twentieth century, a few countries of the world developed space technology and sent hundreds of spacecraft into space.

### Astronouts
Some spacecraft remain in space. Some are brought back to earth while some land on other planets or satellites. In some missions, scientists also travel in spacecraft. They are called astronauts.

### Indian Space Missions
On 22 October 2008, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) launched a spacecraft to the moon. The mission is known as Chandrayaan-1.

Mangalyaan is another important Indian space mission. It is known as M.O.M. or Mars Orbit Mission. It was launched on 5 November 2013. It got established in an orbit around the planet Mars on 24 September 2014. 

ISRO achieved this feat in its first attempt. Both these missions are unmanned. The objective of the missions is a deeper study of the moon and Mars.

### Did you know?
Space scientists have not yet been able to find another planet that has life on it. Therefore, our earth is an invaluable planet. The degradation of its environment for any reason will be a threat to the existence of life itself.

Rakesh Sharma became the first Indian astronaut to go into space in 1984. He spent eight days on a space station for a joint mission of the ISRO and the Soviet Intercosmos.
