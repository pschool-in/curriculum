## Our Earth and Our Solar System- Reading

### Heavenly Bodies
When we look up from an open ground, we see the sky. In a clear night sky, we can see many stars. They are very far away from the earth. The sun and the moon are comparatively close to the earth. So, we can see their round shapes. The sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, etc are all known as heavenly bodies.

### Stars
The heavenly bodies that twinkle are called stars. Stars have their
own light. The sun is a star. It is closer to us than any of the other stars. Hence, it appears big and brilliant. In its bright light, during the
day, we cannot see other stars.

### Planets
The heavenly bodies that do not twinkle are called planets. Planets do
not have light of their own. They get light from the stars. Planets revolve around a star, even as they rotate around themselves.

### Solar System
Our earth is a planet. It gets its light from the sun. It moves around the sun. Its movement around the sun is called the revolution of
the earth. Besides earth, seven other planets revolve around the sun. They are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Every planet in the solar system revolves around the sun along a specific path. This path is known as that planet’s orbit. The sun, which is a star, and the planets that revolve around it are together called the solar system. Besides the planets, the solar system also includes various other heavenly bodies.



## Fill in the Blanks (using options)

```
The sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, etc are all known as *heavenly (heavy)*bodies.
*Stars (Planets)* have their own light.
The *sun (earth)* is a star.
*Planets (Stars)* do not have light of their own.
Planets *revolve (rotate)* around a star, even as they *rotate (revolve)* around themselves.
```

## True or False

```
True:
Besides earth, seven other planets revolve around the sun. 
The heavenly bodies that twinkle are called stars. 
The heavenly bodies that do not twinkle are called planets.

False:
Our earth is not a planet.
Every planet in the solar system rotates around the sun along a specific path.

```

## Name the following. (drag and drop)

```
A heavenly body that twinkles - *stars*
A heavenly body that does not twinkle - *planets*
A specific path around the sun along which a planet revolves around the sun - *orbit*
A star close to the earth - *sun*

```
## Fill in the blanks. (drag and drop)

``` 
Earth's movement around the sun is called *revolution*.
Every planet in the solar system revolves around the sun in a specific path called *orbit*.
In the sun's bright light we cannot see the other *stars* during the day.
*Planets* do not have light of their own.
Planets *rotate* around themselves.
```
### Satelites
Some heavenly bodies revolve around planets. These are called satellites. Satellites too get their light from the sun. We see the moon at night. It revolves around the earth. Hence, it is called a satellite of the earth. The planets revolve around the sun along with their satellites.

### Man - made Satellites
Man-made satellites provide useful information foragriculture, environment, weather forecasting, making maps, and searching for water and mineral wealth on the earth. They are also used for telecommunication. They are put into orbit around the earth. They can remain in space for many years.

### Dwarf Planets
Some smaller heavenly bodies revolve around the sun. They are called dwarf planets. Of these, the most well-known is Pluto. Dwarf planets revolve independently around the sun. They have an orbit of their own.

### Asteroids
Between the planets Mars and Jupiter, there is a band of numerous small heavenly bodies. They are called asteroids. Asteroids also revolve around the sun. Compared to the sun, other heavenly bodies in the solar system are much smaller. The moon is closest to the earth. That is why, it appears to be so big although it is smaller than the sun.

The planets, satellites, dwarf planets and asteroids are all part of the solar system.

### Gravity
All heavenly bodies exert a force of attraction or a pull on one another. This force is called the force of gravity. The sun exerts a gravitational pull on all planets whereas the planets tend to move away from the sun. As a result of these two forces, a planet keeps revolving around the sun at a fixed distance in a fixed orbit. In the same way, satellites revolve around their planets. 

Due to the earth’s gravity, all things on the earth remain on it. Even if we throw something upwards with great force, it finally falls to the ground.

## Group: Man-made Vs Natural
Classify the following as natural or man-made satellites.
```
Man-made: Sputnik, Aryabhatta, Skylab
Natural: Moon, Titan
```
