## Our Earth and Our Solar System- Reading

### Heavenly Bodies
When we look up from an open ground, we see the sky. In a clear night sky, we can see many stars. They are very far away from the earth. The sun and the moon are comparatively close to the earth. So, we can see their round shapes. The sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, etc are all known as heavenly bodies.

### Stars
The heavenly bodies that twinkle are called stars. Stars have their
own light. The sun is a star. It is closer to us than any of the other stars. Hence, it appears big and brilliant. In its bright light, during the
day, we cannot see other stars.

### Planets
The heavenly bodies that do not twinkle are called planets. Planets do
not have light of their own. They get light from the stars. Planets revolve around a star, even as they rotate around themselves.

### Solar System
Our earth is a planet. It gets its light from the sun. It moves around the sun. Its movement around the sun is called the revolution of
the earth. Besides earth, seven other planets revolve around the sun. They are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Every planet in the solar system revolves around the sun along a specific path. This path is known as that planet’s orbit. The sun, which is a star, and the planets that revolve around it are together called the solar system. Besides the planets, the solar system also includes various other heavenly bodies.

```
### Satelites
Some heavenly bodies revolve around planets. These are called satellites. Satellites too get their light from the sun. We see the moon at night. It revolves around the earth. Hence, it is called a satellite of the earth. The planets revolve around the sun along with their satellites.

### Man - made Satellites
Man-made satellites provide useful information for agriculture, environment, weather forecasting, making maps, and searching for water and mineral wealth on the earth. They are also used for telecommunication. They are put into orbit around the earth. They can remain in space for many years.

### Dwarf Planets
Some smaller heavenly bodies revolve around the sun. They are called dwarf planets. Of these, the most well-known is Pluto. Dwarf planets revolve independently around the sun. They have an orbit of their own.

### Asteroids
Between the planets Mars and Jupiter, there is a band of numerous small heavenly bodies. They are called asteroids. Asteroids also revolve around the sun. Compared to the sun, other heavenly bodies in the solar system are much smaller. The moon is closest to the earth. That is why, it appears to be so big although it is smaller than the sun.

The planets, satellites, dwarf planets and asteroids are all part of the solar system.

### Gravity
All heavenly bodies exert a force of attraction or a pull on one another. This force is called the force of gravity. The sun exerts a gravitational pull on all planets whereas the planets tend to move away from the sun. As a result of these two forces, a planet keeps revolving around the sun at a fixed distance in a fixed orbit. In the same way, satellites revolve around their planets. 

Due to the earth’s gravity, all things on the earth remain on it. Even if we throw something upwards with great force, it finally falls to the ground.

## Group: Man-made Vs Natural
Classify the following as natural or man-made satellites.
```
Man-made: Sputnik, Aryabhatta, Skylab

```
### Space
The emptiness between and beyond the stars and planets is called space or outer space.

### Rocket technology
People have always been curious about the heavenly bodies in the sky. They have always wanted to reach them. However, to send some object from the earth into space, it must be given power against the force of gravity. Rocket technology or space launch technology is used for that purpose.

Very powerful rockets are used to send a spacecraft into space. A tremendous quantity of fuel is burnt in rockets so that spacecraft weighing thousands of tons can be launched into space. In the twentieth century, a few countries of the world developed space technology and sent hundreds of spacecraft into space.

### Astronouts
Some spacecraft remain in space. Some are brought back to earth while some land on other planets or satellites. In some missions, scientists also travel in spacecraft. They are called astronauts.

### Indian Space Missions
On 22 October 2008, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) launched a spacecraft to the moon. The mission is known as Chandrayaan-1.

Mangalyaan is another important Indian space mission. It is known as M.O.M. or Mars Orbit Mission. It was launched on 5 November 2013. It got established in an orbit around the planet Mars on 24 September 2014. 

ISRO achieved this feat in its first attempt. Both these missions are unmanned. The objective of the missions is a deeper study of the moon and Mars.

### Did you know?
Space scientists have not yet been able to find another planet that has life on it. Therefore, our earth is an invaluable planet. The degradation of its environment for any reason will be a threat to the existence of life itself.

Rakesh Sharma became the first Indian astronaut to go into space in 1984. He spent eight days on a space station for a joint mission of the ISRO and the Soviet Intercosmos.

## Motions of the Earth -Reading

### Important Terms

Equator: If a circle was drawn around the surface of the Earth exactly in between the north and south poles, it would divide the Earth into two equal parts. This imaginary circle is called the equator.

Hemisphere: The two equal parts the equator makes of the Earth are called the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere.

Rotation: The turning of an object around itself is called rotation and the imaginary line around which it rotates is called its axis of rotation.

Day:  The period that the Earth takes to complete one rotation is called a day. A day has two parts, daytime and night time or simply day and night.

Hour: To measure time, the whole day is divided into 24 parts, each of which is called an hour.

Revolution: Revolution is the movement of the Earth around the Sun. The Earth takes 24 hours to complete a rotation. 

Year: The period the Earth takes to complete one revolution around the sun is called one year. There are about 365 days and 6 hours in a year.

Leap year: In the Gregorian calendar, the year is taken to have 365 days. It means that it counts 6 hours less every year. That makes 24 hours or one day in every four years. To make up for this loss, the month of February in the Gregorian calendar has an extra day every fourth year. That year is called a leap year and it has 366 instead of 365 days and
February has 29 instead of 28 days.

Seasons: The revolution of the Earth and the inclination of its axis give rise to the cycle of seasons. In India, summer, the rainy season and winter are considered to be the main seasons. The year is also divided into six seasons, namely, Vasant, Grishma, Varsha, Sharad, Hemant and Shishir. This cycle of six seasons is called the rituchakra.

Phases of moon: The moon revolves around the Earth and the Earth revolves around the sun. However, these two orbits intersect. Hence, the sun, the moon and the Earth are not always along a straight line. We see half of the moon’s surface which faces the Earth. From the Earth, we see only one side of the moon. The moon has no light of its own. We can see the moon because of the sun’s light that falls on it.
1. Full moon: On a full moon night, we see the entire side of the moon that faces the Earth.
2. New moon: On a new moon night, we cannot see any face of the moon.
From the full moon to the new moon the illuminated part of the moon seen from the Earth becomes smaller and smaller. From new moon to full moon it again grows bigger and bigger. These different shapes of the moon that we see are called the phases of the moon.

Lunar month: It takes 14 or 15 days from new moon to full moon. This is the fortnight of the ‘waxing’ moon. After the full moon, the moon appears smaller and smaller and after 14- 15 days it is new moon again. This period is the fortnight of the ‘waning’ moon. Thus, the period from one new moon to the next is of 28- 30 days. It is called the lunar month.

Lunar day: Every day of the lunar month is called a tithi.
