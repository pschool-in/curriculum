## Evolution of Computer  - Reading

### Evolution to computers

The first use of the word "computer" was recorded in 1613, referring to a person who carried out calculations, or computations.
1. Tally stick: A tally stick was an ancient memory aid device to record and document numbers, quantities, or even messages
2. Abacus: An abacus is a mechanical device used to aid an individual in performing mathematical calculations. It was invented in Babylonia in 2400 B.C.  It is used to perform basic arithmetic operations.
3. Napierâ€™s Bones: Invented by John Napier in 1614. Allowed the operator to multiply, divide and calculate square and cube roots.
4. Slide Rule: Invented by William Oughtred in 1622. Not used for addition or subtraction. 
5. Pascaline: Invented by Blaise Pascal in 1642. It was limited to addition and subtraction. 
6. Stepped Reckoner: Invented by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1672. The machine that can add, subtract, multiply and divide automatically. 
7. Jacquard Loom: The Jacquard loom is a mechanical loom, invented by Joseph-Marie Jacquard in 1881.  It is an automatic loom controlled by punched cards. 
8. Arithmometer: A mechanical calculator invented by Thomas de Colmar in 1820. The first reliable, useful, and commercially successful calculating machine.
9. Difference Engine and Analytical Engine: It is an automatic, mechanical calculator invented by Charles Babbage in 1822 and 1834. It was the first mechanical computer.

### Computer Generations 

There are five generations of computers.

1. First-generation (1946 - 1958): The first computers used vacuum tubes and were very expensive. They relied on machine language and they could only solve one problem at a time.  The input was based on punched cards and paper tape, and the output was in form of printouts. Examples: ENIVAC and UNIVAC-1
2. Second-generation (1959 - 1964): Transistors replaced vacuum tubes. It allowed computers to become smaller, faster, cheaper, more energy-efficient, and more reliable. Second-generation computers used assembly languages. These were also the first computers that stored their instructions in their memory. Examples: IBM 1920, 1BM 1401, etc
3. Third-generation (1965 - 1970): The development of the integrated circuit increased the speed and efficiency of computers. Computers for the first time became accessible to a mass audience.
4. Fourth-generation (1971 - today): The microprocessor brought the fourth generation of computers. These small computers became more powerful. The concept of the Internet was introduced. 
5. Fifth-generation (Today to future): Based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is still in development.
