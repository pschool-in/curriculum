A computer is an advanced electronic device that performs both arithmetic and logical operations.

1. CPU: It is the brain of the computer. It is the central processing unit. It helps in executing the instructions given by the user.

2. Mouse:  It is used to pick items on the screen. When the mouse moves, the pointer also moves.

3. Keyboard: It has keys that we use to type numbers and letters. It helps in feeding information to the CPU.

### Types of storage
1. Primary storage: these are also known as main memory. It includes RAM, ROM, Cache, etc
2. Secondary storage: The CPU cannot access the secondary storage directly. The computer's input or output channels are required to access it. Example: Hard disk
3. Tertiary storage: these are usually very slow and used to store data that is not used frequently. Examples: magnetic tape, optical disc, etc
4. Off-line storage: it is also known as disconnected storage. It is not under the control of the CPU. It must be inserted or connected by a human operator for the computer to access it. Examples: floppy disc, memory card, etc.
