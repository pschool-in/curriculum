### Glossary
Oilcake: After extracting oil from seeds such as groundnut, sesame, or cottonseed, the fibrous component is pressed into slabs. This is known as oilcake.
Ambon is an animal feed made from a fermented mixture of oilcake, jaggery, and coarse grain particles combined with water.

## To each their own food
1. Cows eat grass, hay, oilcake, and ambon.
2. Horses consume soaking Bengal gramme (harbhara), grass, and hay.

6. Deer, bisons, and nilgai eat a wide variety of green grasses, crops, and leaves.
7. Wild animals such as the tiger and lion hunt and eat other animals.When they are starving, they are sometimes driven to enter neighbouring villages. 
The livestock are then killed and taken away.

## Plants need food
1. However, they are unable to travel from one location to another in search of food.
2. Plant roots take up water from the earth. In this water, several soil substances are dissolved. This water reaches the plant's leaves.
3. On the surface of leaves, there are numerous tiny holes. We can't see them with our eyes since they're so small. These pores allow air to penetrate the leaves.
4. As a result, air and water collide in the leaf. Plants use the water and air in their leaves to create their own food with the help of sunlight.
