Chapter - maha g3: Animal Shelters
# Animal Shelters (g3)

## Reading
Why do we need houses?

1. We live in houses to protect ourselves from very cold weather, gusty winds, scorching sun, heavy rains as they can cause us great discomfort.
2. A house also protects us from thefts.
3. It protects the people living close to the forests from wild animals.

Do you know, like us animals also need shelters to protect themselves? 
Some animals build a shelter for themselves while others find them ready in the surroundings.

### Animals who build shelters for themselves
Birds build nests as they are afraid of the animals that eat eggs. Nests protect the young birds as they are too weak to protect themselves.
Nests are made up of grass, straw, and twigs. They may even contain cotton, wool, and pieces of thread and string. 

### Animals that found ready shelters in the surroundings
Some animals do not make any efforts to build a shelter. They simply look around for a safe place. Some live
in small hollows on high cliffs or live near our houses. They find shelter in gaps in walls.

#### Fun Fact
It is believed that a cobra lives in an anthill. But anthills are built by ants, not by a
cobra. The cobras live in holes.

maha g4: The Life Cycle of Animals
# The Life Cycle of Animals (g4)

## Reading
In animals, the babies either grow in their mother's tummy or hatch out of the eggs. Some animals like crows, spiders, and lizards lay eggs. Unlike a chicken, their eggs are tiny. Some animals lay eggs that are too tiny to be observed with naked eyes.

### Hen
A hen lays eggs. The warmth which is provided by the hen to her eggs helps the chick inside the egg to grow. After the full growth, the chick breaks the eggshell and comes out.

Unlike, a chick which does not look very different from a hen, in some animals, the young one grows into an adult animal that looks
very different from the young one. This change of form is called metamorphosis.

### Butterfly
A butterfly has to go through various stages of growth, unlike other animals. These stages are egg, larva, pupa, and adult.
The adult stage is called the butterfly. All the butterflies have to go through these four stages.

## Group: Egg-laying Vs Non-egg laying

Classify the below animals on the basis of whether they lay eggs or not.
```
Lay eggs: Hen, Spider, Frog, Snake, Crow

Chapter - Tamil g3 (Term 3): Animal Life

# Animal Life

## Reading

Animal life can be broadly undertood on the basis of the following:

1. Habitat of animals
2. Undestanding the food procurement by animals
3. Identifying the eating habits of the animals
4. Knowing the mouthparts of the birds and insects
5. By realising the importance of food chain and food web in the environment.

### Animals in different environment
The living place of an animal or a plant is called habitat. The basic needs such as food, water, shelter and place to breed are found in a habitat.
Animals that live on land are called terrestrial animals. E.g., Ants, Cats and Lion. While, Animals that live in water are called aquatic
animals. E.g., Fish, Dolphin and Crab.

### How do animals get their foods?
Animals cannot make their own food. They depend on plants or other plant-eating animals for their food. Some animals can even consume both plants and animals.

### Identification on the basis of eating habits
Animals that eat only plants are called herbivorous animals or herbivores (Plant eaters).
Flesh eating animals are called carnivorous animals or carnivores. 
Some animals eat both plants and the flesh of other animals. These animals are
called omnivorous animals or omnivores. 

### Mouthparts of animals
Mouth parts are different parts of the mouth that are adapted based on the nature of food that the animal eats. It is difficult to identify them sometimes.

### Food chain and food web
A food chain gives us information on how living things are related with
one another by the food they eat. For example, grass is eaten by deer. The deer is eaten
by the tiger.

A Food web is an interconnection of multiple food chains. Transfer of
energy between organisms of different energy sources occurs through food web.

Chapter - Tamil g4 (Term 3): Life of Animals

# Life of Animals

## Reading
Each animal has some unique behaviour. Animal behaviour includes the activities of an animal and its interaction with other organisms.

### Group Behaviour in Animals
Animals gain a lot of benefits from spending time together with other members of the same species. This is called group behaviour.
Honey bees live together in a group and follow a hierarchy. Bees have one queen bee in every hive. There are a few male bees called drones.
There are hundreds of female bees, which are the worker bees.

In birds, Some birds permanently live in groups while others come together only during the breeding season. Not all the bird species build nests. Some of them lay their eggs on the ground or in gap between rocks.

Elephant group is called Herd or Parade. For each group there is a female head, which leads the group towards the availability of food, water and safety.

### Adaptation in Animals
The changes in an animal's behaviour to adjust with its habitat is called adaptation. There are three types of adaptations:

Changes in the physical features of the animal are called structural adaptations. Changes in the functions of the animal‛s body are called physiological adaptations.
Changes in the activities of the animal are behavioural adaptations.

### Structure of Insects
Insects have three main body regions. They are:

The main visible parts on the head are the large
compound eyes, the antennae (feelers) and the mouth parts. The thorax is the middle region of the body. Abdomen The abdomen is the last part of the insect body.

Chapter - Tamil g5 (Term 3): Animals

# Animals

## Reading
Due to increasing exploitation of animals, it is important to understand reproduction in animals, extinction of animals and the ways to preserve them.

### Reproduction in Animals
Reproduction is the biological process by which an organism gives rise to a new organism. There are two types of reproduction in animals: sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction. 

Sexual reproduction consists of the following stages:
a) Pre-fertilization
b) Fertilization 
c) Post-fertilization

Animals in which embryo develops outside the body are called oviparous animals, ex: Butterfly and Frogs. Animals in which the embryo develops inside the
body are called viviparous animals. Humans, cows, deer and dogs are some examples.

The type of reproduction in which only a single parent, gets divided into two new offspring, is known as asexual reproduction. There are four primary ways of asexual reproduction in animals: Fission, Budding, Fragmentation and Spore formation.

### Conservation of Animals
A National park is an area which is strictly reserved for the betterment of
the wild life. The national parks cover an area of 100 – 500 square kilometers. In these areas, private ownership rights are not allowed.

A sanctuary is a protected area which is reserved for the conservation of animals only. Harvesting of timber, collection of forest products and private
ownership rights are allowed here.
