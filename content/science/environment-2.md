## Reading

### What is an environment?

Everything that we see and many many things that we can't see are present in our surroundings and are together known as the environment. For example sunlight, air, water, food, plants, animals, microbes, dust, insects etc.


### The Biosphere

The zone of life where all the life forms interact is called biosphere. It basically includes everything the environment has. It is sub-divided as;
1. Lithosphere: all the land of the environment.
2. Hydrosphere: all the major, minor and minute water-bodies.
3. Atmosphere: envelope of air around the earth.

### The atmosphere

Higher the level above the ground, lesser the oxygen. It includes several other gases like nitrogen, carbondioxide, water vapour etc. Some layers of the atmosphere are:
1. Troposphere: extends 13km from the earth's surface.
2. Stratosphere: extends 50km from the earth's surface.
3. Ozone: protects from harmful UV rays of the sun.


### Water cycle

Water on the earth evaporates continuously due to the heat of the sun. As water vapour is lighter than air, it rises high up into the atmosphere. As it goes higher, cools and condenses to  form clouds.The small droplets join together and form bigger drops which are heavy. Such drops of water fall down as rain. This continuous process of evaporation and condensation is called water cycle.

### Food chain

A worm eats grass and leaves.
A grasshopper eats worms. 
Birds eat Grasshoppers.They are all connected.
One component is food for the next one. That is why we say that they form a chain. Such a chain is called a food
chain. Each of these components is a link in a food chain.

The most important food in a food chain is plants.One living thing can be a part of a number of food chains. That gives rise to
a food web in nature.

### Environmental balance

There are many food chains in our environment. Micro-organisms living in the soil help the process of
decomposition of plant residue, dead animals, excreta, etc. This helps in plant growth.Thus plants use substances in the
soil for their growth and when plants and animals die, the decomposition of their remains adds these substances to
the soil once again. This is an important cycle in the environment.

For the existence of living things, it is important that environmental balance is maintained.

### Types of Environment

There are two main types of environment.
It includes physical environment and biological environment. 

+ Physical environment:all non-living things like land, water and air. 
+ Biological environment:the living things such as plants and animals.

Natural environment has lot of economic values. Plants and animals in our environment are useful to us in a number of ways. These economically important animals are raised in farms.

### Farms

Farming is the activity of growing crops and raising livestock. It is a part of agriculture.An area of land with fields and sturctures devoted to growing crops or raising domestic animals or both as a business is called farm.

+ Diary farm: Type of agriculture that focuses on extraction of milk and preparation of various milk products like cheese, butter, curd, ghee etc.
+ Poultry farms: In poultry farms avian species are reared and bred for the purpose of egg, meat or both. Poultry birds grown for meat are called broilers. Layers are the female fowls grown for egg production.
+ Apiculture: Rearing of honey bee for honey is known as apiculture. It is also called bee keeping. In this technique honey bees are reared in a specially designed wooden box.

### Uses:

+ Bullocks are used to plough land, harvest and thrash crops.
+ Cattle are employed in transportation.
+ Cattle dung is used as manure. It is also used as fuel and for generation of biogas.
+ Panchagavya is an ayurvedic medicine used in agriculture to control pest and fungi.It is a mixer of dung and urine of cows, fresh milk, curd, jaggary and ghee.
+ Leather goods are manufactured from cattle hides.

+ Poultry birds are good source of nutritive food.
+ Their feathers are used for making pillows and quilts.
+ Dropping of the poultry birds is used as manure. It is highly valuable for crops.

+ Honey has an antiseptic and antibacterial property.It builds up haemoglobin content in the blood.
+ Honey is used in Ayurvedic and Unani system of medicines.It prevents cough, cold, fever and relieves sore throat.
+ Honey also enhances digestion and appetite.

+ Bee wax is secreted by worker bee to build the combs of bee hive.It is widely used in cosmetics.

### Manure and Vermiculture

Manure is an organic matter used as fertilizer. It is mostly derived from animal and plant residues. It increases the fertility of the soil. It is a natural form of fertilizer.

+ Farmyard manure: It contains the feces and urine of different livestock.
+ Green manure: It is obtained by decomposition of green leaves, twigs of trees, shrubs and herbs.
+ Compost: It is obtained by decomposition of organic matter by various microorganisms.

Vermiculture or Vermicomposting is a method of transforming organic wastes such as waste papers, leaves, pieces of woods etc., into
a nutrient rich fertilizer using earth worms. 

+ It is a healthy and clean way to eliminate wastes going into our landfills.
+ It keeps the environment clean.
+ It improves the water holding capacity of the soil and prevents soil erosion.
