### What is an environment?

Our surroundings and all the living and non living things are together known as the environment. It includes
many components such as sunlight, air,
water, soil, plants and animals, etc.
The earth is surrounded by the atmosphere. Water, land
and air constitute envelopes of the earth,
namely, the hydrosphere, lithosphere and
atmosphere. The biosphere spreads in all
the other three spheres.


### The lithosphere and the hydrosphere

The lithosphere is the solid part of the Earth such as rocks and mountains.The hydrosphere is the liquid water such as the rivers,lakes and oceans.About a third of the surface of the earth
consists of land.Two-thirds of the earth’s surface is
covered with water.

### The atmosphere

The envelope of air around the earth is
called the atmosphere. As we go higher
from the surface of the earth, the air in the
atmosphere becomes rarer. The atmosphere
consists of a mixture of gases, namely,
nitrogen, oxygen, water vapour and carbon
dioxide. There are some other gases too in
the air in very small quantities.

The layer that extends from the earth’s
surface to a height of about 13 km is called
the troposphere.

Beyond the troposphere, up to a height
of about 50 km from the earth is the layer
called the stratosphere.In the lower part
of the stratosphere, there is a layer of a gas
called ozone.The ozone layer absorbs Ultraviolet rays and protects
the living world from these rays.


### Water cycle

Water on the earth evaporates
continuously due to the heat of the sun.As water vapour is lighter
than air, it rises high up into the atmosphere.
As it goes higher, it cools and condenses
forming very fine droplets of water forming clouds.These small droplets join together and form
bigger drops which are heavy. They cannot
float. Such drops of water fall down on the
earth in the form of rain.this continuous process of evaporation and condensation is called water cycle.
 
### Biosphere

Many different kinds of
plants, animals and micro-organisms are found everywhere on the earth - on land, in water and in the air. The zone of life where all the life forms interact is called biosphere

### Food chain

A worm eats grass and leaves.
A grasshopper eats worms. Birds eat
Grasshoppers.They are all connected.
Each of the components is food for the next
one. That is why we say that they form
a chain. Such a chain is called a food
chain. Each of these components is a link
in a food chain.

The most important food in a food chain is plants.One living thing can be a part of a number of food chains. That gives rise to
a food web in nature.

### Environmental balance

There are many food chains in our
environment. Micro-organisms living in the soil help the process of
decomposition of plant residue, dead animals, excreta, etc.
This helps in plant growth.Thus plants use substances in the
soil for their growth and when plants and animals die, the decomposition of their remains adds these substances to
the soil once again. This is an important cycle in
the environment.

For the existence of living things,
it is important that environmental
balance is maintained.

### Types of Environment

There are two main types of environment.
It includes physical environment and biological environment. 

Physical environment includes all non-living things like land, water and air. Biological environment includes the living things such as plants and animals.

 Natural environment has lot of economic values. Plants and animals in our environment are useful to us in a number of ways. Animals like cow, buffalo and goat give us milk. Some animals are used for
transportation. These animals are raised in farms.


### Farms

Farming is the activity of growing crops and raising livestock. It is a part of agriculture. 

Agriculture is the cultivation of land and breeding of animals and plants to provide food, fiber, woods and medicinal plants to sustain and enhance life.

An area of land with fields and buildings that is devoted primarily to growing crops or raising domestic animals or both as a business is called farm.

### Diary farm

Dairy farming is a type of agriculture that focuses on extraction of milk and preparation of various milk products like cheese, butter, curd etc.

Buffaloes produce more amount of milk than cows. Also, buffalo
milk has more nutrients than cow’s milk.India is the biggest buffalo milk producer in the world.

The cattle feed includes roughage and concentrates. The roughage contains high amount of fiber. Apart from these feed, cattle need an adequate amount of fresh water.

Foot and mouth disease and anthrax are some of the common diseases found among cattle.

Veterinary medicine deals with the prevention, diagnosis and
treatment of disease, disorder and injury for domestic and non-domestic animals.

Bullocks are used to plough land, harvest and thrash crops.
Cattle are employed in transportation.
Cattle dung is used as manure. It is also used as fuel and for generation of biogas.
Panchagavya is an ayurvedic medicine used in agriculture to control pest and fungi.It is a mixer of dung and urine of cows, fresh milk, curd, jaggary and ghee.
Leather goods are manufactured from cattle hides.

### Poultry farms

In poultry farms avian species are reared and bred for the purpose of egg, meat or both. Fowls, ducks, geese, turkeys and some varieties of pigeon are the most commonly reared species. Chicken occupy 90% of the total poultry. Poultry birds grown for meat are called broilers. Layers are the female fowls grown for egg production.

Fowls are mainly of two types. They include meat type (broiler), egg type (egg layer) and dual type.

Poultry birds need proteins, carbohydrates, fats, minerals and vitamins for egg and meat production. Bajra, barley, maize, wheat, rice bran, jowar, oil cake, fish meal, bread and green residues of vegetables are the feed given to the poultry birds.

Poultry birds are good source of nutritive food.
Their feathers are used for making pillows and quilts.
Dropping of the poultry birds is used as manure. It is highly valuable for crops.

Poultry birds affected by virus suffer from fever and diarrhea.
Foul cholera is caused in them by bacteria.
Over exposure to wet and cold conditions causes cramps in poultry birds.
Poultry birds are affected by internal parasites.

### Apiculture

Rearing of honey bee for honey is known as apiculture. It is also called bee keeping. In this technique honey bees are reared in a specially designed wooden box. Honey bees have been very closely associated with humans since ancient times. Various products like honey and wax are obtained from honey bees.

The queen is the largest member of the bee colony. There is only one
queen and it is the fertile female of the colony.

Drones are the fertile males. Worker bees are sterile female bees and the smallest members of the colony. These bees are very active. Their function is to collect honey, look after the young ones, clean the comb, defend the hive and maintain the temperature of the bee hive.

Honey contains proteins, amino acids, vitamins and minerals like calcium, iron, phosphorus and manganese.

Honey has an antiseptic and antibacterial property.It builds up haemoglobin content in the blood.
Honey is used in Ayurvedic and Unani system of medicines.It prevents cough, cold, fever and relieves sore throat.
Honey also enhances digestion and appetite.

Bee wax is secreted by worker bee to build the combs of bee hive.It is widely used in cosmetics.

### Manure

Manure is an organic matter used as fertilizer. It is mostly derived from animal and plant residues. It increases the fertility of the soil by adding nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. It is a natural form of fertilizer.

Common form of animal manure is the farmyard manure. It contains the feces and urine of different livestock.Green manure is obtained by decomposition of green leaves, twigs of trees, shrubs and herbs.
Compost is obtained by decomposition of organic matter by various
microorganisms.

### Vermiculture

Vermiculture or Vermicomposting is a method of transforming organic wastes such as waste papers, leaves, pieces of woods etc., into
a nutrient rich fertilizer using earth worms. It is a healthy and clean way to eliminate wastes going into our landfills. It keeps the environment clean.It improves the water holding capacity of
the soil and prevents soil erosion.

### What are wastes?

Nature provides us a lot of useful things.We use these natural resources and create more trash. The unwanted materials thrown away are called wastes. They can be solid, liquid and gas. They are produced from households, industries, hospitals etc., These unwanted materials pollute our environment.

### Waste Management 

It is the step we take to handle our waste and to make sure our environment does not get dirty and polluted. Waste management deals with both biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste.

### Steps in waste management

There are four main steps in waste management.
These includes : 1. Separation of Waste
 2. Waste collection and transportation
3. Waste recycling and composting 
4. Waste disposal

### What are the three R‛s in waste management

The three R‛s stand for REDUCE, REUSE, RECYCLE. We must first reduce,
then reuse and finally recycle.

Reduce is to make or use less materials.
Reuse is using a thing repeatedly for the same or for another purpose.
Recycle is to take materials from things you throw away and make new products by using them. Recycling takes energy and time but saves the amount of ‘new‛ resources we need to make things.

### Waste Separation

Waste at home should be separated into biodegradable, recyclable
and non-recyclable waste. Waste like left over food, vegetable waste which are broken down naturally should be collected in a separate litter box. Materials which cannot be decomposed should be placed in separate dustbin. Paper waste, glass waste and aluminium waste which can be recycled into new useful products should be kept in separate box.

### Environment friendly materials

Things that can be decomposed or broken down by microorganisms are
biodegradable. They can return to the soil and enrich the soil. Materials which are beneficial to the environment and do not cause harm are called eco-friendly materials.

## Group : Biodegradable vs Non biodegradable

Classify the below items based on its degrading capacity.

Biodegradable : Plants, Fruits, Flowers, Vegetables, Animals

Non biodegradable: Glass, Metal, Electronic devices, Plastics, Batteries, Computer parts

## Group : Blue waste vs Red waste

Classify the below  items based on its recycling capacity.

Blue waste: newspapers, magazines, glass, cardboard, food tins, tetra packs.

Red waste: plastic wrap, bubble wrap, wax, used towels.

## Match the following

Match the foods with their major nutrients.

```
Plastic waste, Threat to environment
Waste separation, Biodegradable, recyclable and non-recyclable
Reduce, Reuse and Recycle, Three R‛s
Stainless steel,Eco-friendly material

```

## Multiple Choice Questions

```
________ is used to make bags, dustbins and tooth brushes.
Bamboo, cotton,jute

Plastic plates stay in the environment for over _______ years.

1000, 100, 2000

Glass containers for food and beverages are ________ recyclable.

100%, 90%, 80%

Moving the waste from one place to another is called _________.

Transportation, waste collection, land-filling

```

## Fill in the Blanks (By Drag Drop)

Drag and drop the words at proper places.

```
Things that can be decomposed or broken down by microorganisms are
*biodegradable*.
Picking up the waste is called *Waste collection*.
*Compost* makes the soil fertile.
