# Environment-2

## Reading

### What is an environment?

Our surroundings and all the living and non living things are together known as the environment. It includes
many components such as sunlight, air,
water, soil, plants and animals, etc.
The earth is surrounded by the atmosphere. Water, land
and air constitute envelopes of the earth,
namely, the hydrosphere, lithosphere and
atmosphere. The biosphere spreads in all
the other three spheres.


### The lithosphere and the hydrosphere

The lithosphere is the solid part of the Earth such as rocks and mountains.The hydrosphere is the liquid water such as the rivers,lakes and oceans.About a third of the surface of the earth
consists of land.Two-thirds of the earth’s surface is
covered with water.

### The atmosphere

The envelope of air around the earth is
called the atmosphere. As we go higher
from the surface of the earth, the air in the
atmosphere becomes rarer. The atmosphere
consists of a mixture of gases, namely,
nitrogen, oxygen, water vapour and carbon
dioxide. There are some other gases too in
the air in very small quantities.

The layer that extends from the earth’s
surface to a height of about 13 km is called
the troposphere.

Beyond the troposphere, up to a height
of about 50 km from the earth is the layer
called the stratosphere.In the lower part
of the stratosphere, there is a layer of a gas
called ozone.The ozone layer absorbs Ultraviolet rays and protects
the living world from these rays.


### Water cycle

Water on the earth evaporates
continuously due to the heat of the sun.As water vapour is lighter
than air, it rises high up into the atmosphere.
As it goes higher, it cools and condenses
forming very fine droplets of water forming clouds.These small droplets join together and form
bigger drops which are heavy. They cannot
float. Such drops of water fall down on the
earth in the form of rain.this continuous process of evaporation and condensation is called water cycle.
 
### Biosphere

Many different kinds of
plants, animals and micro-organisms are found everywhere on the earth - on land, in water and in the air. The zone of life where all the life forms interact is called biosphere

### Food chain

A worm eats grass and leaves.
A grasshopper eats worms. Birds eat
Grasshoppers.They are all connected.
Each of the components is food for the next
one. That is why we say that they form
a chain. Such a chain is called a food
chain. Each of these components is a link
in a food chain.

The most important food in a food chain is plants.One living thing can be a part of a number of food chains. That gives rise to
a food web in nature.

### Environmental balance

There are many food chains in our
environment. Micro-organisms living in the soil help the process of
decomposition of plant residue, dead animals, excreta, etc.
This helps in plant growth.Thus plants use substances in the
soil for their growth and when plants and animals die, the decomposition of their remains adds these substances to
the soil once again. This is an important cycle in
the environment.

For the existence of living things,
it is important that environmental
balance is maintained.

For the existence of living things, it is important that *environmental balance* is maintained.
Biosphere is also known as *the zone of life*.
One *living thing* can be a part of a number of food chains.
Our surroundings and all the living and non living things are together known as the *environment*.
The *biosphere8 spreads in all the other three spheres.

```


## Fill in the Blanks (using options)

```
About *a third (two-third)* of the surface of the earth consists of land.
Micro-organisms living in the soil help the process of *decomposition (evaporation)* of plant residue, dead animals, excreta, etc.
As we go higher from the surface of the earth, the air in the atmosphere becomes *rarer (denser)*.
Each of the components in a food chain is called a *link (web)*.
The lithosphere is the *solid (liquid)* part of the Earth such as rocks and mountains.

## True or False

```

The zone of life where all the life forms interact is called biosphere.
The ozone layer absorbs Ultraviolet rays and protects the living world from these rays.
Water vapour cools and condenses forming very fine droplets of water forming clouds.


False:
