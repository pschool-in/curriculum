## Passage-2

### The Little Sister

We know very well that the Statue of Liberty was a gift to the US from the French. After all these years, this US independence day, France gifted the country a smaller Statue of Liberty, its replica, 'The Little Sister'. This statue was displayed in the Ellis Island, in front of the Liberty Island, from 1st to the 5th of July. Later, it got shifted to the French Embassy in Washington D.C. Before being shipped to the US, 'The Little Sister' spent ten years welcoming visitors at the Conservatoire National des Arts et MÃ©tiers (CNAM) in Paris.
