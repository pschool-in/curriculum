## Read the story carefully and answer the questions that follow.
```
Four little rabbits Fluffy, Snuffy, Bunny and Sunny lived with their mother Mrs Bobtail in a cozy, warm burrow next to a big house which had a big vegetable garden. Now,the owners of the big house hated all pests including rabbits, and had laid cruel traps all over the garden to catch them. Mrs Bobtail kept her four little rabbits close to the burrow and often  warned them of the danger of going into the big garden next door!
"Now my dears," said Mrs Bobtail one morning, "I am going out shopping, you may stay at home, play in the feild, or go down the lane and pick blackberries, but don't go into the  garden next door." "Goodbye, and don't get into mischief!"
Mrs Bobtail then took her shopping bag and umbrella and went down the lane to the bakery where she bought a loaf of brown bread and five cream buns.
Meanwhile, Fluffy, Snuffy and Sunny who were good little rabbits, went down the lane with little baskets to pick blackberries.
But Bunny, who was very disobedient and naughty, ran to the big garden next door, by  squeezing through a tunnel under the wall!
