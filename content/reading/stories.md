## A Thirsty Crow

One hot day, a thirsty crow flew all over the fields looking for water. For a
long time, he could not find any. He felt very weak, almost lost all
hope.Suddenly, he saw a water jug below the tree. He flew straight down to see
if there was any water inside. Yes, he could see some water inside the jug!

The crow tried to push his head into the jug. Sadly, he found that the neck of
the jug was too narrow. Then he tried to push the jug to tilt for the water to
flow out, but the jug was too heavy.

The crow thought hard for a while. Then, looking around it, he saw some pebbles.
He suddenly had a good idea. He started picking up the pebbles one by one,
dropping each into the jug. As more and more pebbles filled the jug, the water
level kept rising. Soon it was high enough for the crow to drink. His plan had
worked! The crow drank the water happily and flew in the sky singing his
favorite song.

Moral: Think smart, you may find a solution to any problem.

## The Woodcutter and the Axe

Long ago, there lived a woodcutter in a small village. He was sincere in his
work and very honest. Every day, he went into the nearby forest to cut trees. He
brought the woods back into the village and sold them to a merchant and earned
his money. He earned just enough to make a living, and he was satisfied with his
simple living.

One day, while cutting a tree near a river, his axe slipped out of his hand and
fell into the river. The river was so deep, he could not take it on his own. He
had only one axe that fell into the river. He started to worry. He will not be
able to earn his living now! He was very sad and prayed to the God. He prayed
sincerely and God appeared in front of him and asked, “What is the problem, my
son?” The woodcutter explained the problem and requested the God to get his axe
back.

The God stretched his hand deep into the river and took out a silver axe and
asked, “Is this your axe?” The Woodcutter looked at the axe and said “No”. So,
the God put his hand back deep into the water again and took a golden axe and
asked, “Is this your axe?” The woodcutter looked at the axe and said “No”. The
God said, “Take a look at it again Son, this is a very valuable golden axe. Are
you sure, this is not yours?” The woodcutter said, “No, It’s not mine. I cannot
cut trees with a golden axe. It’s not useful to me”.

The God smiled and finally put his hand into the water again and took out his
iron axe and asked, “Is this your axe?” To this, the woodcutter said, “Yes! This
is mine! Thank you!” The God was very impressed with his honesty and she gave
him his iron axe and also the other two axes as a reward for his honesty.

## A Fox and A Goat

Once upon a time, a fox was roaming around in the dark. Unfortunately, he fell
into a well. He tried his level best to come out, but was not able to come out.
So, he had no other alternative but to remain there until the next morning. The
next day, a goat came that way. She peeped into the well and saw the fox there.
The goat asked, “What are you doing there, Mr. Fox?”

The sly fox replied, “I came here to drink water. It is the best I have ever
tasted. Come and drink yourself.” Without thinking even for a while, the goat
jumped into the well, quenched her thirst and looked for a way to get out. But
just like the fox, she also found herself helpless to come out.

Then the fox said, “I have an idea. You stand on your hind legs. I’ll climb on
your head and get out. Then, I shall help you also to come out.” The goat was
innocent and did not realise the cunningness of the fox, and so did as the fox
said and helped him to get out of the well. While walking away, the fox said,
“Had you been intelligent enough, you would never have jumped in without
thinking how to get out.

## The Bear and the Two Friends

Once upon a time, two friends were walking through the forest. They knew that
any danger can happen to them at any time in the forest. So, they promised each
other that they would remain united in any case of danger.

Suddenly, they saw a huge bear approaching them. One of the friends at once
climbed a nearby tree. But the other one did not know how to climb. So, being
led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless, pretending to be
a dead man.

The bear came near the man lying on the ground. It smelt him with his nose, and
left the place. It is because, bears do not touch dead creatures. Now, the
friend on the tree came down and asked his friend on the ground, “Friend, what
