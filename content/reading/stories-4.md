## The Four Friends

Long, long ago, there lived three friends in a jungle. They were a deer, a crow
and a mouse. They used to share their meals together.

One day, a turtle came to them and said, "I also want to join your company and
become your friend. I'm all alone."

"You're most welcome," said the crow. "But, what about your personal safety,
there are many hunters around. They visit this jungle regularly. Suppose, a
hunter comes, how will you save yourself?"

"That is the reason why I want to join your group," said the turtle.

No sooner had they talked about it, a hunter appeared on the scene. Seeing the
hunter, the deer darted away; the crow flew in the sky and the mouse ran into a
hole. The turtle tried to crawl away fast, but he was caught by the hunter. The
hunter tied him up in the net. He was sad to lose the deer. But he thought, it
was better to feast on the turtle rather than to go hungry.

The turtle's three friends became much worried to see his friend trapped by the
hunter. They sat together to think of some plan to free his friend from the
hunter's snare.

The crow, then, flew high up in the sky and spotted the hunter walking along the
river bank. As per the plan, the deer ran ahead of the hunter unnoticed and lay
on the hunter's path as if dead.

The hunter saw the deer from a distance, lying on the ground. He was very happy
to have found it again. "Now I'll have a good feast on it and sell its beautiful
skin in the market," thought the hunter. He put down the turtle on to the ground
and ran to pick up the deer.

In the meantime, as planned, the mouse gnawed through the net and freed the
turtle. The turtle hurriedly crawled away into the river water.

Unaware of the plot of these friends, the hunter went to fetch the deer for its
tasty flesh and beautiful skin. But, what he saw with his mouth wide open was
that, when he reached near, the deer suddenly sprang up to its feet and darted
away into the jungle. Before he could understand anything, the deer disappeared.

Dejected, the hunter turned back to collect the turtle he had left behind on the
ground in the snare. But he was shocked to see the snare lying nibbled at and
the turtle missing. For a moment, the hunter thought that he was dreaming. But
the damaged snare lying on the ground was proof enough to confirm that he was
very much awake and he was compelled to believe that some miracle had taken
place.

The hunter got frightened on account of these happenings and ran out of the
jungle. The four friends once again started living happily.

## The Mice that Ate Balance

Once upon a time, there lived a wealthy merchant, in a village. He ran a big
business. His village was situated near a river. Once, due to heavy rain, the
river was flooded. One night, the whole village was submerged in neck deep
water. The crops, houses and factories in the village were destroyed and
hundreds of people and cattle perished in the flood.

The merchant had to suffer heavy losses in his business. He decided to shift to
some other town to try his luck. His plan was to earn a lot of money and then
come back to his native village to start his business again.

The merchant had a heavy iron balance lying with him. It belonged to his
ancestors. It was not possible for him to carry such a heavy thing along with
him. So, before starting on his journey, he decided to keep this ancestral item
with his friend Ravi. He met Ravi and requested him, "My friend, as you know,
I'm leaving for some distant place to earn money, so that I could start my
business once again when I come back. I have an old iron balance with me. Will
you please keep it safe with you till I return?"

Ravi readily agreed to his friend's request and said, "Don't worry, I'll keep it
safe for you. You can take it back after you return home." The merchant thanked
Ravi for his helping attitude. He kept the iron balance with Ravi and left for
some other distant town.

A few years passed by. By this time, the merchant had done good business and had
earned a lot of money. He returned to his native village, and went to his friend
Ravi's house to meet him. Ravi showed his happiness in meeting the merchant.
Both the friends talked together for hours. When it was time to leave, the
merchant asked his friend to return his iron balance. At this, Ravi looked sad
and said, "Friend, I am sorry to say that I don't have your balance with me
anymore. There are a lot of mice in my house. They ate up your balance."

The merchant was surprised to hear Ravi's explanation. 'How can mice eat iron,'
he thought to himself, but apparently he said something different, "Don't feel
sorry, Ravi. The mice have always proved a menace to everyone. Let us forget
about it."

"Yes," Ravi said. "This is the only way out." He was happy that the merchant
believed his words. In fact he had expected a lot of heated arguments in this
respect.

While taking leave from his friend, the merchant said to Ravi, "I'm going to
temple to make an offering of laddoos. Could you please send your son with me. I
would like to send some laddoos for you also. He would also look after my shoes
outside the temple while I offer prayers inside.

Ravi asked his son to go along with the merchant. Then, the merchant, instead of
taking Ravi's son to temple, took him to a nearby hill and tied him with a big
rock and came back home.

When Ravi didn't see his son return, he asked the merchant where his son was.
"I'm sorry," said the merchant. "While your son was looking after my shoes
outside the temple, a big vulture swooped down upon him and carried him away."

"What nonsense!" shouted Ravi. "How can a vulture carry off a young boy?" But
the merchant repeatedly claimed that a vulture carried away Ravi's son. The
argument reached such a point that they began quarrelling with each other, using
dirty words.

Ultimately the matter had to be taken to the court. The Judge listened to both
the parties and ordered the merchant to bring Ravi's son to the court,
otherwise, he would be sent to jail.

"My Lord", said the merchant, "How can I, when a vulture has already carried
away the boy."

"Shut up!" the judge reprimanded the merchant. "How can a bird carry away a
young boy?"

"It can, my lord," said the merchant. "If mice can eat my iron balance, why
can't a bird carry away a grown up boy." Then he narrated the whole story to the
judge.

The judge then asked Ravi to tell the truth. He warned him that if he didn't
tell the truth he would be sent to prison. At last, Ravi admitted his guilt. The
judge ordered him to return the iron balance to the merchant. He asked the
merchant to return the boy to Ravi.

## The Well Dispute

Once there was a complaint at King Akbar's court. There were two neighbours who
shared their garden. In that garden, there was a well that was possessed by
Iqbal Khan. His neighbour, who was a farmer wanted to buy the well for
irrigation purpose. Therefore, they signed an agreement between them, after
which the farmer owned the well.

Even after selling the well to the farmer, Iqbal continued to fetch water from
the well. Angered by this, the farmer had come to get justice from King Akbar.
King Akbar asked Iqbal the reason for fetching water from the well even after
selling it to the farmer. Iqbal replied that he had sold only the well to the
farmer but not the water inside it.

King Akbar wanted Birbal who was present in the court listening to the problem
to solve the dispute. Birbal came forward and gave a solution. He said, "Iqbal,
You say that you have sold only the well to the farmer. And you claim that the
water is yours. Then how come you can keep your water inside another person's
well without paying rent?"

Iqbal's trickery was countered thus in a tricky way. The farmer got justice and
Birbal was fairly rewarded.

## Stone Soup

Some travellers came to a village, carrying nothing more than an empty cooking
pot. Upon their arrival, the villagers were not willing to share any of their
food with the hungry travellers. Then, the travellers went to a stream and
filled the pot with water, dropped a large stone in it, and placed it over a
fire.

One of the villagers became curious and asked what they were doing. The
travellers answered that they were making "stone soup", which tasted wonderful
and which they would be delighted to share with the villager, although it still
needed a little bit of garnish, which they were missing, to improve the flavour.

The villager, who wanted to get a share of the soup, did not mind parting with a
few carrots. So they were added to the soup. Another villager walked by,
inquiring about the pot, and the travellers again mentioned their stone soup
which had not yet reached its full potential.

The villager handed them a little bit of seasoning. More and more villagers
walked by, each adding another ingredient. Finally, the stone (being inedible)
was removed from the pot, and a delicious and nourishing pot of soup was enjoyed
by the travellers and villagers alike. Though the travellers tricked the
villagers into sharing their food with them, they have successfully transformed
it into a tasty and nutritious meal which they shared with the donors.

## The Man and the Tree

One day, a man climbed up a tree. While climbing up, he did not realise how tall
the tree actually was and kept climbing up. On reaching the top, when the man
looked down, he realised that climbing down from the tree would not be as easy
as climbing up. He could not think of any way of getting down without injuring
himself seriously.

He asked the people who were passing by to help him. But nobody could think of a
way of bringing him down safely. Soon, quite a few people gathered around the
tree and tried to help the man, but no one knew what to do. The man remained
stuck on top of the tree.

Just then, Mulla, who was walking by, saw this scene and wondered what was going
on. The people standing around the tree told Mulla about the situation. “Oh!”
Mulla said, “I’ll get him down in no time.” He took a long rope and threw one
end of it up to the man telling him to tie the rope around his waist.

Everyone wondered what Mulla’s plan was. When one of them asked him, Mulla
replied, “Just leave it to me. It’s a great plan.”

When the man on the tree had tied the rope tightly around his waist, Mulla
pulled the rope with all his force. As soon as Mulla did this, the man fell down
from the tree and hurt himself badly. The bystanders were shocked at this. They
turned to Mulla and asked, “What did you do? What a silly plan you had?”

Mulla replied, “Well, once I did exactly the same thing and saved someone’s
life.” One man asked him, “Is that true?” “Absolutely!” replied Mulla, “The only
difference was I saved him from a well and not a tree.”
