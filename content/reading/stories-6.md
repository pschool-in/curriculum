# Cinderella

Once upon a time, there was a kind girl named Cinderella. She lived with her stepmother and her two stepsisters. 
But they were very cruel to Cinderella. They made her work all day.

One day, they were all invited for a party in the king's palace. The king wanted to find a bride for the prince.
Cinderella was very excited about the party. But the step-mother took only her daughters to the party.

As Cinderella was crying in the locked house, a Fairy Angel appeared. The Angel turned a pumpkin into an elegant coach. 
And with her magic wand, she created beautiful dress and sparkling glass slippers. She asked Cinderella to go to the party
and warned her to return by 12 o'clock as her magic wont work beyond that.

Cinderella went to the party and all eyes are on her. The prince requested her to dance with him. When the time was about 12 o'clock, she suddenly ran away from the party.
The prince followed, but she vanished leaving behind her single slipper.

The prince wanted to marry Cinderella but was unable to find her. The king sent messengers everywhere to find the girl that matches the slipper. 
It matched with no other girls except Cinderella. Finally the prince found Cinderella, got married and lived happily forever.
