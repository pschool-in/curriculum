One day, they were all invited for a party in the king's palace. The king wanted to find a bride for the prince.
Cinderella was very excited about the party. But the step-mother took only her daughters to the party.

As Cinderella was crying in the locked house, a Fairy Angel appeared. The Angel turned a pumpkin into an elegant coach. 
And with her magic wand, she created beautiful dress and sparkling glass slippers. She asked Cinderella to go to the party
and warned her to return by 12 o'clock as her magic wont work beyond that.

Cinderella went to the party and all eyes are on her. The prince requested her to dance with him. When the time was about 12 o'clock, she suddenly ran away from the party.
The prince followed, but she vanished leaving behind her single slipper.

## The Jungle Book

One day, Bagheera, a panther, found an abandoned human baby in the forest. He carried the baby to his friends, the wolves. The wolves raised the baby as their own. They named him Mowgli. A few years passed and Mowgli turned into a young boy and adapted to the forest life. The panther gave him training in hunting.

Sher Khan, a tiger was not happy about Mowgli growing with wolves. He wanted to have the boy for dinner, and constantly asked the wolves to hand over the boy to him.

In order to protect Mowgli from Sher Khar, the wolves decided to send Mowgli to the village in the border of the forest. But the journey was not smooth. He faced many challenges and also got a good friend in Baloo, a bear.

After spending time with Baloo, Mowgli decided not to go anywhere from the forest. He ran back to his pack of wolves. But he was stopped by the tiger. When the tiger was about to catch Mowgli, there was a lightning bolt that set a nearby tree on fire. Mowgli found that the tiger was afraid of fire. He took a burning branch and ran towards the tiger. Out of fear, the tiger jumped from a huge height and was never seen again.

Mowgli, Bagheera and Baloo were finally relieved.
