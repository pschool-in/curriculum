So, the God put his hand back deep into the water again and took a golden axe and asked, “Is this your axe?” The woodcutter looked at the axe and said “No”. The God said, “Take a look at it again Son, this is a very valuable golden axe. Are you sure, this is not yours?” The woodcutter said, “No, It’s not mine. I cannot cut trees with a golden axe. It’s not useful to me”.\n        The God smiled and finally put his hand into the water again and took out his iron axe and asked, “Is this your axe?” To this, the woodcutter said, “Yes!

He was very clever and spontaneous. Sri Krishna Devaraya had some special type of brinjal plants in his garden. The brinjal was a very rare kind and the curry made out of it was very tasty which was loved by the king. As it was a rare type, the garden was guarded and no one was allowed to see the plants without the king’s permission.\n        Once the emperor arranged an excellent dinner for his advisors and the brinjal curry was served. Tenali Rama enjoyed the brinjal curry very much and went home. But, he was unable to forget the taste. He told his wife about the taste of the curry. Tenali Rama’s wife also liked brinjal curry, she asked Tenali Rama to bring home few brinjals, so that she can prepare a curry. But, Tenali Rama knew that the king was taking extreme care about the brinjal plants and he can easily find out even if one brinjal was missing from his garden. And, the king would punish such a thief severely, if he was caught stealing a brinjal from his garden.\n        But, Tenali’s wife pleaded him to bring a brinjal from the garden without telling anyone. Tenali Rama had no choice other than stealing a brinjal from the emperor’s garden. One night, he went to the garden, jumped over the wall and plucked few brinjals from the garden. Tenali Rama was happy that no one had seen him. His wife cooked the brinjals and the curry was very tasty. Like all mothers, she too loved her son very much and wanted to serve the brinjal curry to him. But, Tenali Rama asked her not to do such a thing, because if their son revealed to anyone that he had a rare brinjal curry, then they may get caught and get punished for stealing a brinjal from the garden.\n        But his wife did not agree. She wanted to serve the curry to her son. She was unable to eat the curry alone without serving her little kid who was sleeping after doing his homework on the roof of their house. She asked Tenali Rama to find a way so that their son can also taste the brinjal curry. Tenali Rama also loved his son, so he thought of an idea. With hesitation, he went to the roof to wake up his child with a bucket of water, and poured the water on the child. When the child woke up, he said “It is raining. Let’s go inside the house and have dinner”. After going inside the room, he changed the clothes of his son and gave him the rice and brinjal curry for the dinner. Tenali Rama told his wife loudly that “it was raining outside, and let the boy sleep in the room”.\n        Next day, the emperor came to know that few brinjals were missing in his garden. The Gardener who kept the count of each vegetable and flower found that three brinjals were missing. It became a challenging issue for the emperor and so he took it very seriously. He announced a reward for the person who can catch the thief. The gardener told the king that only Tenali Rama was capable of doing such things. The emperor sent a few policemen and asked Tenali Rama to come immediately. Once Tenali Rama came he asked him about the missing brinjals. Then Tenali Rama told, “I was not aware of the missing brinjals”. Then the gardener told “Tenali Rama was lying. Let’s enquire his son”.\n        The king sent his policemen to bring Tenali Rama’s son. Once his son came, the king asked what vegetable he had for dinner last night. The child replied, “The brinjal curry and it was very tasty”. Then, the king told Tenali Rama that he must accept his crime. But Tenali Rama said his son slept very early, and he might be saying something which he saw in his dream.\n        So, the king asked the little kid that “can you please explain clearly what you did yesterday after coming from the school?”\n        Tenali Rama’s son replied that “yesterday after coming from the school, I played for some time and after that, I went on to the roof, did my homework, and slept on the roof. But when the rain started, my father came and woke me up. By that time my dress was fully wet, then we went inside, had dinner and slept again”.\n        The gardener was shocked because there was no rain at all yesterday. So, they thought the kid had a dream and allowed Tenali Rama to go without any punishment. However, Tenali Rama told the truth to the king later, and was pardoned by the emperor for his clever witty idea.","moral":"Moral: Stealing is not a good virtue!

But just like the fox, she also found herself helpless to come out.\n        Then the fox said, “I have an idea. You stand on your hind legs. I’ll climb on your head and get out. Then, I shall help you also to come out.” The goat was innocent and did not realise the cunningness of the fox, and so did as the fox said and helped him to get out of the well.\n        While walking away, the fox said, “Had you been intelligent enough, you would never have jumped in without thinking how to get out.”","moral":"Moral: Look before you leap.

A push or pull is called force. This force helps us to do many things. It can make an object move. It can  stop a moving object. It can change the shape of an object, change the speed of the moving object and change the size of the object. There are different types of forces that act on a body.\n          When you throw a ball up, no matter how high it goes, it is sure to come down. This is because of gravitational force. This force attracts objects to the center of the earth.\n          When two objects touch each other, a special type of force develops between them. This special force is called friction. Friction slows down movements. When friction is very less, things move easily. When frictions is more, it becomes difficult to move things. A wet floor is slippery because there is very little friction. Friction makes it possible for you to write. You cannot hold a pencil in your hand without friction. It would slip out from your hands.
