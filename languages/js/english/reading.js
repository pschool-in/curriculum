        text: ` One hot day, a thirsty crow flew all over the fields looking for water. For a long time, he could not find any. He felt very weak, almost lost all hope.Suddenly, he saw a water jug below the tree. He flew straight down to see if there was any water inside. Yes, he could see some water inside the jug!
        The crow tried to push his head into the jug. Sadly, he found that the neck of the jug was too narrow. Then he tried to push the jug to tilt for the water to flow out, but the jug was too heavy.
        The crow thought hard for a while. Then, looking around it, he saw some pebbles. He suddenly had a good idea. He started picking up the pebbles one by one, dropping each into the jug. As more and more pebbles filled the jug, the water level kept rising. Soon it was high enough for the crow to drink. His plan had worked! The crow drank the water happily and flew in the sky singing his favorite song.

        text: ` Long ago, there lived a woodcutter in a small village. He was sincere in his work and very honest. Every day, he went into the nearby forest to cut trees. He brought the woods back into the village and sold them to a merchant and earned his money. He earned just enough to make a living, and he was satisfied with his simple living.
        One day, while cutting a tree near a river, his axe slipped out of his hand and fell into the river. The river was so deep, he could not take it on his own. He had only one axe that fell into the river. He started to worry. He will not be able to earn his living now! He was very sad and prayed to the God. He prayed sincerely and God appeared in front of him and asked, “What is the problem, my son?” The woodcutter explained the problem and requested the God to get his axe back.
        The God stretched his hand deep into the river and took out a silver axe and asked, “Is this your axe?” The Woodcutter looked at the axe and said “No”. So, the God put his hand back deep into the water again and took a golden axe and asked, “Is this your axe?” The woodcutter looked at the axe and said “No”. The God said, “Take a look at it again Son, this is a very valuable golden axe. Are you sure, this is not yours?” The woodcutter said, “No, It’s not mine. I cannot cut trees with a golden axe. It’s not useful to me”.
        The God smiled and finally put his hand into the water again and took out his iron axe and asked, “Is this your axe?” To this, the woodcutter said, “Yes! This is mine! Thank you!” The God was very impressed with his honesty and she gave him his iron axe and also the other two axes as a reward for his honesty.`,

        text: `Tenali Rama was an advisor to the King Krishna Devaraya. He was very clever and spontaneous. Sri Krishna Devaraya had some special type of brinjal plants in his garden. The brinjal was a very rare kind and the curry made out of it was very tasty which was loved by the king. As it was a rare type, the garden was guarded and no one was allowed to see the plants without the king’s permission.
        Once the emperor arranged an excellent dinner for his advisors and the brinjal curry was served. Tenali Rama enjoyed the brinjal curry very much and went home. But, he was unable to forget the taste. He told his wife about the taste of the curry. Tenali Rama’s wife also liked brinjal curry, she asked Tenali Rama to bring home few brinjals, so that she can prepare a curry. But, Tenali Rama knew that the king was taking extreme care about the brinjal plants and he can easily find out even if one brinjal was missing from his garden. And, the king would punish such a thief severely, if he was caught stealing a brinjal from his garden.
        But, Tenali’s wife pleaded him to bring a brinjal from the garden without telling anyone. Tenali Rama had no choice other than stealing a brinjal from the emperor’s garden. One night, he went to the garden, jumped over the wall and plucked few brinjals from the garden. Tenali Rama was happy that no one had seen him. His wife cooked the brinjals and the curry was very tasty. Like all mothers, she too loved her son very much and wanted to serve the brinjal curry to him. But, Tenali Rama asked her not to do such a thing, because if their son revealed to anyone that he had a rare brinjal curry, then they may get caught and get punished for stealing a brinjal from the garden.
        But his wife did not agree. She wanted to serve the curry to her son. She was unable to eat the curry alone without serving her little kid who was sleeping after doing his homework on the roof of their house. She asked Tenali Rama to find a way so that their son can also taste the brinjal curry. Tenali Rama also loved his son, so he thought of an idea. With hesitation, he went to the roof to wake up his child with a bucket of water, and poured the water on the child. When the child woke up, he said “It is raining. Let’s go inside the house and have dinner”. After going inside the room, he changed the clothes of his son and gave him the rice and brinjal curry for the dinner. Tenali Rama told his wife loudly that “it was raining outside, and let the boy sleep in the room”.
        Next day, the emperor came to know that few brinjals were missing in his garden. The Gardener who kept the count of each vegetable and flower found that three brinjals were missing. It became a challenging issue for the emperor and so he took it very seriously. He announced a reward for the person who can catch the thief. The gardener told the king that only Tenali Rama was capable of doing such things. The emperor sent a few policemen and asked Tenali Rama to come immediately. Once Tenali Rama came he asked him about the missing brinjals. Then Tenali Rama told, “I was not aware of the missing brinjals”. Then the gardener told “Tenali Rama was lying. Let’s enquire his son”.
        The king sent his policemen to bring Tenali Rama’s son. Once his son came, the king asked what vegetable he had for dinner last night. The child replied, “The brinjal curry and it was very tasty”. Then, the king told Tenali Rama that he must accept his crime. But Tenali Rama said his son slept very early, and he might be saying something which he saw in his dream.
        So, the king asked the little kid that “can you please explain clearly what you did yesterday after coming from the school?”
        Tenali Rama’s son replied that “yesterday after coming from the school, I played for some time and after that, I went on to the roof, did my homework, and slept on the roof. But when the rain started, my father came and woke me up. By that time my dress was fully wet, then we went inside, had dinner and slept again”.
        The gardener was shocked because there was no rain at all yesterday. So, they thought the kid had a dream and allowed Tenali Rama to go without any punishment. However, Tenali Rama told the truth to the king later, and was pardoned by the emperor for his clever witty idea.`,

So, he had no other alternative but to remain there until the next morning. The next day, a goat came that way. She peeped into the well and saw the fox there. The goat asked, “What are you doing there, Mr. Fox?”
        The sly fox replied, “I came here to drink water. It is the best I have ever tasted. Come and drink yourself.” Without thinking even for a while, the goat jumped into the well, quenched her thirst and looked for a way to get out. But just like the fox, she also found herself helpless to come out.
        Then the fox said, “I have an idea. You stand on your hind legs. I’ll climb on your head and get out. Then, I shall help you also to come out.” The goat was innocent and did not realise the cunningness of the fox, and so did as the fox said and helped him to get out of the well.
        While walking away, the fox said, “Had you been intelligent enough, you would never have jumped in without thinking how to get out.”`,

        The bear came near the man lying on the ground. It smelt him with his nose, and left the place. It is because, bears do not touch dead creatures. Now, the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend on the ground, “Friend, what did the bear tell you in your ears?” The other friend replied, “The bear advised me not to believe a false friend.”`,

        The man wanted to get all the golden eggs from his hen at one single go. So, one day he thought hard and at last came with a plan. He decided to kill the hen and get all the eggs together.
        So, the next day when the hen laid a golden egg, the man caught hold of it, took a sharp knife, chopped off its neck and cut its body open. There was nothing but blood all around and there was no trace of any golden egg. He was very sad, because now he would not get even one single golden egg.
        His life was going on smoothly with one golden egg a day, but now, he himself made his life miserable. Just because of his greediness, he became very poor.`,
