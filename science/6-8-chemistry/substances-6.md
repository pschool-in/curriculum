## Separation of Substances - Reading
### Methods of separation
Handpicking, winnowing, sieving, sedimentation, decantation and filtration are some of the methods of separating substances from their mixtures.

### Handpicking

Handpicking is used for separating slightly larger sized impurities like peices of dirt, stone and husk from wheat, rice or pulses. The quantity of such impurities is usually not very large.

### Threshing
The process used to separate grain from stalks is called threshing. The stalks are beaten to free the grains. Machines and bullocks are sometimes used for the process.

### Winnowing
Winnowing is used to separate heavier and lighter components of a mixture by wind or by blowing air. It is commonly used by farmers to separtae lighter husk particles from heavier seeds of grain. The husk particles are carried away by the wind. The seeds of grain get
separated and form a heap.

### Sieving
Sieving allows the fine flour particles to pass through the holes of the sieve while the bigger impurities remain on the sieve.

### Sedimentaion, Decantation and Filtration
When the heavier component in a mixture settles after water is added to it, the process is called sedimentation. Removal of water along with the dust is called decantation. Filtration can be used to separate components of a mixture of an insoluble solid and a liquid.

### Evapouration
The process of conversion of water into its vapour is called evaporation. The process of evaporation takes place continuously wherever water is present.

### Condensation
The process of conversion of water vapour into its liquid form is called condensation.

### Use of more than one method of separation.
Some mixtures require more than one separation method to completely separate the substances. For example, to separate sand and salt from the water collected from an ocean we need to use decantation, filtration, evaporation and condensation.

### Saturated solution
A saturated solution is one in which no more of that substance can be dissolved. More of a substance can be dissolved in a solution by heating it.

### Can water dissolve any amount of a substance?
Water dissolves different amount of soluble substances in it.

### Fill in the blanks (drag and drop)
```
Husk and stones could be separated from grains by *handpicking*.
Husk is separated from heavier seeds of grain by *winnowing*.
Difference in the size of particles in a mixture is utilised to separate them by the process of *sieving* and filtration.
In a mixture of sand and water, the heavier sand particles settle down at the bottom and the water can be separated by *decantation*.
*Filtration* can be used to separate components of a mixture of an insoluble solid and a liquid.
```
### Fill in the blanks (by options)
```
*Evaporation (Condensation)* is the process in which a liquid gets converted into its vapour.
Evaporation can be used to separate a *solid (liquid)* dissolved in a liquid.
A *saturated (unsaturated)* solution is one in which no more of that substance can be dissolved.
More of a substance can be dissolved in a solution by *heating (cooling)* it.
Water dissolves different amount of *soluble (insoluble)* substances in it.
```
### Answer in one word. (drag and drop)
```
The method of separating seeds of paddy from its stalks is called: *threshing*
When milk, cooled after boiling, is poured onto a piece of cloth the cream is left behind on it. This process of separating cream from milk is an example of: *filteration*
Salt is obtained from seawater by the process of: *evapouration*
Impurities settled at the bottom when muddy water was kept overnight in a bucket. The clear water was then poured off from the top. The process of separation used in this example is called: *decantation*
```
### True or False
```
True: Seeds of paddy can be separated from husk by threshing.
Stones can be separated by handpicking.

False: A mixture of water and milk can be separarted by filterartion.
Separation of sugar from tea can be done by filteration.
Salt is obtained from sea water by decantation.
```
### Saturated or Unsaturated
Classify the given solutions based on level of saturation.
```
Saturated: Water with a cup of salt.
Coffee with 10 packets of sugar.
Milk with a cup of chocolate powder

Unsaturated: Water with a pinch of salt.
ORS made with a pinch of salt and sugar in a cup of water.
```
### Filteration or seiving 
Classify based on the method of separation used.
```
Filterartion: Air filter that removes impurites from air.
Water filter that remove impurities from water.

Seiving: Flour is passed through seive in baking processes.
Cement is sifted before mixing.
Tea leaves separated from tea using strainer.
```
