## Air Around Us - Reading
### Is air present everywhere around us?
Air is found everywhere. We cannot see air, but we can feel it. Air in motion is called wind. Air occupies space. Air is present in water and soil. The envelope of air that surrounds the earth is known as atmosphere. Atmosphere is essential for life on earth.

### Composition of Air
Air is a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapour and a few other gases. Some dust particles may also be present in it. Oxygen and nitrogen make upto 99% of air. The other 1% is constituted by carbon dioxide and a few other gases, water vapour, smoke and dust.

### Water vapour
The presence of water vapour in air is important for the water cycle in nature. The presence of water vapour in air is mainly due evapouration and condensation.

### Oxygen
Oxygen is the companent of air which supports burning. Oxygen is essential for life to exist.

### Nitrogen
The major component of air is nitrogen. It is also the component of air that does not support burning.

### Carbon Dioxide
Carbon dioxide makes up a small component of the air around us. Plant and animal matter also consumes oxygen on burning and produces mainly carbon dioxide and a few other gases. It is advisable not to burn dry leaves and discarded remains of the crop, which pollute our surroundings.

### Dust and Smoke
The burning of fuel also produces smoke. Smoke contains a few gases and fine dust particles and is often harmful. Dust particles are always present in air. We inhale air when we breathe through our nostrils. Fine hair and mucus are present inside the nose to prevent dust particles from getting into the respiratory system.

## Oxygen - Reading
### How does oxygen become available to animals and plants?
The plants and animals that live in water use oxygen that is dissolved in water. Plants and animals living in the soil use air trapped in small air pockets in the soil. When it rains heavily these air pockets get filled with water. Then the organisms come out for oxygen.

### How is oxygen in the atmosphere replaced?
Plants produce oxygen during photosynthesis. Plants also
consume oxygen for respiration, but they produce more of it than they consume. The balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is maintained through respiration in plants and animals and by the photosynthesis in plants. This shows the interdependence of plants and animals.
