## Fibre to Fabric - Reading
### Variety in Fabrics
There is a lot of variety in fabrics. The clothing material or fabric can be made of cotton, jute, silk, wool, nylon or polyster.

### Fibre
The thin strands of thread are made up of even thinner strands called fibre. Fabrics are made of yarns and yarns are further made of fibres. The fibres of fabrics such as cotton, jute, silk and wool are obtained from plants and animals. They are called natural fibres. Fibres made from chemical substances are called synthetic fibres.Polyster, nylon and acrylic are synthetic fibres.

### Cotton 
Cotton is obtained from friut of cotton plant. The fibres are usually picked by hand and then separated from the seeds by combing. This process is called ginning.

### Jute
Jute is obtained from sttem of jute plant. The stems are immersed in water for a few days and then the fibres are separated by hand.

### Spinning Cotton Yarn
The process of making yarn from fibres is called spinning. In this process , fibres from a mass of cotton wool are drawn out and twisted to form yarn. Some spinning devices include hand spindle or takli and charkha which was popularised by Mahatma Gandhi. Clothes made of homespun yarn are called khadi.

### Weaving
The process of arranging two sets of yarns together to make a fabric is called weaving. Weaving of the fabric is done on looms which can be operated by power or by hand.

### Knitting
In knitting, a single yarn is used to make a piece of fabric. Socks and many other clothing items are made of knitted fabrics. It can be done by hand or on machines.

## History of Clothing Material - Reading
### History 
In ancient times, people used bark, big leaves, animals skins and fur to cover themselves. After people began to settle in agricultural communities, they learnt to weave twigs and grass into mats and baskets. Vines, animal fleece or hair were twisted together into long strands. These were woven into fabrics. 

The early Indians wore fabrics made out of cotton that grew in the regions near the river Ganga. Flax is also a plant that gives natural fibres. 

In ancient Egypt, cotton as well as flax were cultivated near the river Nile and were used for making fabrics. In those days, stitching was not known. People simply draped the fabrics around different parts of their body. With the invention of the sewing needle, people started stitching fabrics to make clothes.
