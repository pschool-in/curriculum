### Objects Around us.
If we take a look around us we may find a large variety of objects. These objects are made up from a variety of materials. A given material could be used to make a large number of objects. It is also possible that a an object could be made of a single material or of many different types of materials. These materials may be glass, metal, plastics, wood, cotton, paper, mud or soil.

### Properties of Materials.
1. *Appearence:* Some materials have lustre like metals and are shiny in appearence while some are dull.
2. *Hardness:* Materials that are easily compressed are called soft while others which are difficult to compress are called hard.
3. *Solubility:* Some materials readily dissolve in water. These are said to be soluble. Other materials that do not mix with water are said to be insoluble.
4. *Float or Sink:* Some materials float on the surface of water while some others sink to the bottom.
5. *Transparency:* Some materials such as glass, are transparent and some others such as wood and metals are opaque. The materials through which objects can be seen, but not clearly, are known as translucent.

Materials are grouped together based on similarities and differences in their properties. Things are grouped together for convenience and to study their properties.

Materials that are easily compressed are called *soft (hard)* while others which are difficult to compress are called *hard (soft)*.
Some materials readily dissolve in water. These are said to be *soluble (insoluble)*. 
Materials that do not mix with water are said to be *insoluble (soluble)*.
Some materials such as glass, are *transparent (transclusent)* and some others such as wood and metals are *opaque (transparent)*. 
The materials through which objects can be seen, but not clearly, are known as *translucent (trasparent)*.
