### Can all changes be reversed?
Some changes can be reversed and some cannot be reversed. Those changes which cannot be reversed are called irreversible changes.

### Other ways to bring a change
Iron structures are heated to fit them into wooden handle. Iron expands on heating. Metal rim is also mounted on wooden wheel with the same technique. Cold water is used to contract the metal and fit tightly onto the wheel. Water can be changed to vapour by heating. Candle melts on heating. A small quantity of curd is added to warm milk. The milk is stirred and is set aside for a few hours at a warm place. In a few hours, the milk changes into curd. 

### Yes or No
Are the following processes reversible?
```
Yes: Wet clothes to dry clothes.
Woollen yarn to knitted sweater.
Cold milk to hot milk.
Straight sting to coiled string.
Streched rubber band to its normal size.
Ice cream to molten ice cream.

No: Raw egg to boiled egg.
Batter to idli.
Grain to flour.
Bud to flower.
Milk to paneer.
Cow dung to biogas.
```
### Reversible or Irreversible
Classify based on the reversiblity of the process.
```
Reversible: Melting of ice into water.
Drying of clothes.
Streching of rubber band.

Irreversible: The sawing of a peice of wood.
The cooking of food.
Ripening of mango.
Souring of milk.
```
### True or False.
```
True: Only some changes are reversible.
Changes that cannot be reversed are said to be irreversible.

False: All changes can be reversed.
Iron has no changes on heating.
Cooking of food is a reversible change.
```
