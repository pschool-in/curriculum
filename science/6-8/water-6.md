## Water - Reading

### Where do we get water from?

Each of us may be getting water into our homes in different ways. But, finally, all of us get water from the same sources such as ponds, lakes, rivers and wells.

### Water Cycle

The circulation of water between ocean and land is known as the water cycle. 

### Loss of Water by Plants

Plants use a part of the water they absorb to prepare their food and retain some of it in their different parts.
Remaining part of this water is released by the plants into air, as water vapour through the process of transpiration.

### How are clouds formed? 

At sufficient heights, the air becomes so cool that the water vapour present in it condenses to form tiny drops of water called droplets. It is these tiny droplets that remain floating in air and appear to us as clouds. Many drops of water join together to faorm large drops of water.
Some drops of water become so heavy that they begin to fall to form rain.

### Back to the ocean

Most of the water that falls on the land as rain and snow
sooner or later goes back to the oceans. This happens in many ways. Snow in the mountains melts into water. This water flows down the mountains in the form of streams and
rivers. Some of the water that falls on land as rain, also flows in the form of rivers and streams. Most of the rivers cover long distances on land and ultimately fall into a sea or an ocean. However, water of some rivers flows
into lakes. A part of the rainwater gets absorbed by the ground and seems to disappear in the soil. Some of this water is brought back to the air by the process of evaporation and transpiration. The rest seeps into the ground. Most of this water becomes available to us as ground water. 
Excessive rains may cause floods while lack of it for long periods may cause droughts.

### Conservation of water

The demand for water is increasing day-by-day. The number of people using water is increasing with rising population. In many cities, long queues for collection of water are a common site. Also, more and more water is being used for producing food and by the industries. These factors are leading to shortage of water in many parts of
the world. Hence, it is very important that water is used carefully. We should take care not to waste water

### Rainwater Harvesting

One way of increasing the availability of water is to collect rainwater and store it for later use. Collecting rainwater in this way is called rainwater harvesting.

1. Rooftop rainwater harvesting: In this system the rainwater is collected from the rooftop to a storage tank, through pipes. This water may contain soil from the roof and need filtering before it is used. Instead of collecting
rainwater in the tank, the pipes can go directly into a pit in the ground. This then seeps into the soil to recharge or refill the ground water.

2. Another option is to allow water to go into the ground directly from the roadside drains that collect rainwater.


### Multiple Choice Questions 


```
What is formed when the water vapour in air condenses to form droplets of water?
Cloud
Hail
Snow

What will happen when there is excessive rainfall?
Flood
Drought
Hailstrom

What will happen when there is no rainfall for a long period of time?
Drought
Flood
Eartquake

```
### Evapouration or Condensation

```
Evapouration: Steam risisng from a hot girdle when water is sprinkled on it.
Steam rising from weat clothes while they are ironed.
Blackboard dries up after wiping it.

Condensation: Water drops appear on the outer surface of a glass containing cold water.
Fog appearing on a cold winter morning.
```

### True or False

```
True: The process of water changing into its vapour is called evaouration.
Rainwater harvesting helps to conserve water.

False: Water vapour is present in air only during the monsoon. 
Water evaporates into air from oceans, rivers and lakes but not from the soil.
```
