### Methods of separation
Handpicking, winnowing, sieving, sedimentation, decantation and filtration are some of the methods of separating substances from their mixtures.

### Handpicking

Handpicking is used for separating slightly larger sized impurities like peices of dirt, stone and husk from wheat, rice or pulses. The quantity of such impurities is usually not very large.

### Threshing
The process used to separate grain from stalks is called threshing. The stalks are beaten to free the grains. Machines and bullocks are sometimes used for the process.

### Winnowing
Winnowing is used to separate heavier and lighter components of a mixture by wind or by blowing air. It is commonly used by farmers to separtae lighter husk particles from heavier seeds of grain. The husk particles are carried away by the wind. The seeds of grain get
separated and form a heap.

### Sieving
Sieving allows the fine flour particles to pass through the holes of the sieve while the bigger impurities remain on the sieve.

### Sedimentaion, Decantation and Filtration
When the heavier component in a mixture settles after water is added to it, the process is called sedimentation. Removal of water along with the dust is called decantation. Filtration can be used to separate components of a mixture of an insoluble solid and a liquid.

### Evapouration
The process of conversion of water into its vapour is called evaporation. The process of evaporation takes place continuously wherever water is present.

### Condensation
The process of conversion of water vapour into its liquid form is called condensation.

### Use of more than one method of separation.
Some mixtures require more than one separation method to completely separate the substances. For example, to separate sand and salt from the water collected from an ocean we need to use decantation, filtration, evaporation and condensation.

### Saturated solution
A saturated solution is one in which no more of that substance can be dissolved. More of a substance can be dissolved in a solution by heating it.

### Can water dissolve any amount of a substance?
Water dissolves different amount of soluble substances in it.
