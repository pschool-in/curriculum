## Getting to know plants - Reading
### Points to remember

1. Plants are usually grouped into herbs, shrubs and trees based on their height, nature of stem and branches.
2. The stem bears leaves, flowers and fruits.
3. Leaf usually has a petiole and lamina.
4. The pattern of veins on the leaf is called venation. It can be reticulate or parallel.
5. Leaves give out water vapour through the process of transpiration.
6. Green leaves make their food by the process of photosynthesis using
carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight.
7. Roots absorb water and minerals from the soil. They also anchor the
plant firmly in the soil.
8. Roots are mainly of two types: tap root and fibrous root.
9. Plants having leaves with reticulate venation have tap roots while plants having leaves with parallel venation have fibrous roots.
10. The stem conducts water from roots to the leaves (and other parts) and food from leaves to other parts of the plant.
11. The parts of a flower are sepals, petals, stamens and pistil.
