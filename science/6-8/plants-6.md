### Herbs, Shrubs and Trees

The plants that we see around us can be classified into herbs, shrubs or trees based on the height of the plant, the nature of the stem and based on the point of branching. The plants which are short with green and tender stems are catergorized as herbs.They may not have many branches. Trees are very tall with thick and hard stem. For trees the branching points appear higher up on the thick and hardened stem. Shrubs have moderate height with a hard stem but branching points appear at the base of the stem.

### Stem

Stem supports a plant and bear leaves, branches, buds, flowers and fruits.Plants with weak stems that cannot stand upright but spread on the ground are called creepers, while those that take support and climb up are called climbers. Stem helps in upward movement of water. The water and minerals go to the leaves and other plant parts attached to the stem.

### Leaf

Leaves are attached to the stem by a structure called petiole. The broad green part of the leaf is called lamina. The lines on a leaf are called veins. The prominent line in the middle of the leaf is a midrib. The design made by the veins in a leaf is called the leaf venation. If the design is net like on both sides of the midrib then the venation is said to be reticulate. If the design is parallel to one another as in grass, then the venation is called parallel venation. Water comes out of eaves in the form of vapour by a process called transpiration. Leaves prepare their food in the presence of sunlight and a green coloured substance present in them. For this, they also use water and carbon dioxide. This process is called photosynthesis. Oxygen is given out in this process. The food prepared by leaves ultimately gets stored in different parts of plant.

### Root

Roots act as an anchor that hold the plant firmly to the soil. Different types of plants have different stucture for roots as well. The two main type of roots are tap root and fibrous root. In a tap root system the main root is called tap root and the smaller roots are called lateral roots. In fibrous root system the plant lacks a main root and the roots seem similar. These are called fibrous roots. Roots of some plants such as carrot, radish, sweet potato, turnip and tapioca are edible.

### Flower
The most prominent and colourful part of a flower are called petals. The smal leaf like stuctures that are seen on a flower are called sepals. The innermost part of a flower is called the pistil. Stamens usually surround the pistil. Pistil contains the ovary, style and stigma. The ovary contains ovules.

### Points to remember

1. Plants are usually grouped into herbs, shrubs and trees based on their height, nature of stem and branches.
2. The stem bears leaves, flowers and fruits.
3. Leaf usually has a petiole and lamina.
4. The pattern of veins on the leaf is called venation. It can be reticulate or parallel.
5. Leaves give out water vapour through the process of transpiration.
6. Green leaves make their food by the process of photosynthesis using carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight.
7. Roots absorb water and minerals from the soil. They also anchor the plant firmly in the soil.
8. Roots are mainly of two types: tap root and fibrous root.
9. Plants having leaves with reticulate venation have tap roots while plants having leaves with parallel venation have fibrous roots.
10. The stem conducts water from roots to the leaves (and other parts) and food from leaves to other parts of the plant.
11. The parts of a flower are sepals, petals, stamens and pistil.
