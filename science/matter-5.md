## Matter and Materials

Our needs have increased in the modern days and we use number of things in our daily life. We get some of them from the nature and some other things are manufactured artificially. The things you use like pen, pencil, ink, eraser, note book, ball and the food you eat, all have different nature and characteristics. They are obtained by transforming the natural and artificial substances.

We know, matter can exist in three physical states: solid, liquid and gas. It is made up of molecules and the molecules are made up of atoms.

In solids, molecules are very closely arranged. Solids are incompressible. They have definite shape, size and volume.

In liquids, molecules are loosely packed. Hence, liquids are semi compressible. They have definite volume, but no definite shape and size.

In gases, molecules are very loosely packed. Hence, gases are highly compressible.

A material is a mixture of substances that constitute an object. They can be pure or impure, natural or man made. Materials are needed to get the things needed for our daily life. We need food, dress and many other goods for our daily living. Natural and man made materials are transformed to produce these things.

### Household Goods

These are the products that we use in our house permanently. The goods that are found in a house permanently are called household goods. House hold goods are: furniture, kitchenware, cloths, towels, beddings, boots and electronic goods.

### Sinking and Floating

You could have seen that some objects float in water while others sink. Whether an object floats or sinks is determined by its density. When an object is immersed into a liquid, the liquid exerts an upward force on the object. It is known as upthrust. What happens if you put a coin and an empty water bottle in water? The weight of the coin is greater than the upthrust and so the coin sinks. But weight of the empty water bottle is less and so it floats.

### Solubility in Water

Some substances completely dissolve in water. We say that these substances are soluble in water. Other substances do not dissolve in water even after we stir for long time. These substances are insoluble in water.

### Experiment

Take a small cup of water and add a small amount of salt. Stir it with a spoon. Check whether salt is soluable in water. Repeat the same experiment with sugar, saw dust and sand.

### Mixing of liquids

Certain liquids are heavier (dense) than other liquids. When you attempt to mix liquids which have different densities they separate when you stop mixing them.

The heavier liquid deposits at the bottom and the lighter liquid floats on the top. For example, oil and water do not mix together.

## Fibres

Fibre is a thin thread of natural or artificial substances. It is used to make cloths with the help of powerlooms or weaving machines. 

The fibres we get from plants and animals are called natural fibres. Cotton, jute, coir, flax, hemp are examples for plant fibres. Wool and silk are examples for animal fibres. 

Fibres made by humans by chemical synthesis are called synthetic fibres or artificial fibre. Rayon, nylon, acrylic and dacron are examples for artificial fibres. These fibres are obtained from petroleum by complex chemical processes.

### Cotton

A cotton plant is a bushy plant of 5 to 6 feet high. Cotton grows well in black soil and alluvial soil. The cotton plant bears a large number of small green pods called cotton balls. These balls contain seeds covered with white fibres. When the cotton balls mature, they burst exposing the white fibre of cotton. Cotton is usually hand picked from the plants.

### Ginning

The raw fibres are separated from the seeds by a process known as Ginning. The fibrous material left after separating cotton seeds is called lint. The lint is then tied and pressed into balls. Short fibres and other impurities are removed by the process of combing. 

### Spinning

The process of making yarn from lint (fibre) is called spinning. Spinning is done on a large scale with the help of  spinning machines.

### Yarn to fabrics

Weaving and knitting are the two most important processes used for making fabric from the yarn. The process of making  two sets of yarns together to make fabric is called weaving. It is done by weavers on a machine called loom. The loom are either hand â€“ operated (hand looms) or power - operated. During knitting a single yarn is used to make a piece of fabric. It is done by hand and also on machine.

### Uses of cotton

1. It is used for making dhotis, sarees, bedsheets, table cloth and other textiles and garments.
2. It is used as fillers in pillows and mattresses.
3. It used for making surgical bandages.

### Jute

Jute fibre is obtained from the stem of the jute plant. Jute plant has long, soft and shiny fibres. It is also referred to as the golden fibre due to its colour and cost effectiveness. Jute fibres are separated from the process of retting jute by hand and then they are dried. These are converted into yarns in the same manner as cotton.

### Uses of Jute

1. It is used for making bags, carpets, curtains and ropes.
2. It is used for making sacks for storing grains.
3. It is used for making wall hangings for decoration.

### Coir

Coir fibre is obtained from the outer covering of coconut. It is used to make floor mats, door mats, brushes and mattresses.

### Synthetic Fibres

These fibres are made by human beings with the help of chemical process. They are also called as manmade fibre. These fibres are obtained from coal, petroleum and natural gas.

### Uses of synthetic fibres

1. Rayon is used to make rope, cloth, cap, tyre cords and carpets.
2. Nylon is used to make fishing nets, ropes, parachutes, fabrics and bristles for brushes.
3. Polyester is used to make fabric for suits and shirts, hoses, conveyer belts, films, PET bottles and wires. 
4. Acrylic is used to make sweaters, shawls and blankets.

## Grains

Grain is a small, hard, dry seed. Each grain is protected by a husk. Two main types of commercial grain crops are cereals and legumes. Wheat, maize, rice, beans, peas, barely and millets are some of the whole grains.

### Wheat

This is the most important crop in the world. Whole wheat is rich in fibre, vitamins and minerals. Some of the common wheat products are bread, cake and pasta.

### Maize

In many tropical and sub tropical countries (Mexico and America) maize is the main food that people eat. It is also rich source of many vitamins and minerals. Corn syrup is used as a sweetener instead of sugar in many products.

### Rice

Rice is a type of grass. Ninety percent of the world's rice production is in Asia. White rice contains few essential nutrients. Brown rice is a whole grain that contains the fibrous bran. Brown rice is usually considered much healthier than white rice.

### Millets

Millets are a group of small seeded grasses. They are widely grown around the world as cereal crops for fodder and human food. It helps in weight loss. It is rich in fibre. Some of the millet products are sorghum, fox tail millet, finger millet, pearl millet, Barnyard millet.
