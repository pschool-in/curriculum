# Reaching the Age of Adolescence - Reading

```
Humans become capable of reproduction after puberty sets in.
Children between the ages of 11 and 19 years are called adolescents.
The human body undergoes several changes during adolescence. These changes mark the onset of puberty.
The onset of puberty brings about growth of the reproductive organs.
Hair grow at various places on the body.
Breasts develop in girls and facial hair appear in boys.
As these features help to distinguish the male from the female they are called secondary sexual characters.
Voice of boys becomes hoarse as voice box enlarges during adolescence.
Children gain height during adolescence.
The onset of puberty and maturity of reproductive parts are controlled by hormones.
Hormones are secretions of endocrine glands which pour them directly into the blood stream.
Endocrine glands release hormones into the bloodstream to reach a particular body part called target site.
Pituitary gland secretes hormones which include growth hormone and hormones that make other glands such as the testes, ovaries, thyroids and adrenals, secrete hormones.
Pancreas secretes insulin, thyroid produces thyroxine and adrenals produce adrenalin.
Testosterone is the male hormone and estrogen, the female hormone.
The uterine wall in females prepares itself to receive the developing fertilised egg.
In case there is no fertilisation, the thickened lining of the uterine wall breaks down and goes out of the body along with blood. This is called menstruation.
Sex of the unborn child depends on whether the zygote has XX or XY chromosomes.
It is important to eat balanced food and maintain personal hygiene during adolescence.
