## Food - Reading
### Food variety
There is so much variety in the food we eat. Some dishes only require two materials or ingredients whereas some food items are made with many ingredients. Some ingredients we use in our daily life are salt, sugar, spices, rice, vegetables, oil etc.

### Food materials and sources
Plants are the sources of food ingredients like grains, cereals,vegetables and fruits. Animals provide us with milk, meat products and eggs. Cows, goats and buffaloes are some common animals which give us milk. Milk and milk products like butter, cream, cheese and curd are used all over the world.

### Plant products and Animal products as food
Plants are one source of our food. We eat fruits of some plants and leafy veagetables of some other plants. Sometimes we also consume roots, stems and even flowers of plants. Some plants have more than one edible parts. For example, seeds of mustard plants give us oil and the leaves are used as a vegetable. Some common animal products we eat are eggs, milk and honey. Bees collect nectar from flowers, convert it into honey and store it in their hive. We collect the food stored by the bees as honey and use as an ingredient.

### What do animals eat?
Animals which eat only plants are called herbivores. Animals which eat only animals are called carnivores.Animals which eat both plants as well as other animals are called omnivores.

# Objectives
1. To understand what different food items contain? 
2. To understand what do various nutrients do for our body? 
3. To understand more about balanced diet and deficiency diseases.

## Componenets of Food - Reading
### What do different food items contain?
Every dish contains one or more ingredients which maybe plant or animal based. These ingredients contain some components that are needed by our body called nutreints. The major nutrients in our food are named carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals. In addition, food contains dietary fibres and water which are also needed by our body.

### Test for Carbohydrate
First a dilute solution of iodine is prepared by adding a few drops of tinture iodine to a test tube half filled with water. Now take a small quantity of food item or a raw ingredient and add 2-3 drops of dilute iodine solution. A blue-black colour change indicates the presence of starch.

### Test for Protein
Copper sulphate solution is prepared by dissolving 2 grams of copper sulphate in 100 millilitre of water. Then dissolve 10 grams of caustic soda  in 100 ml of water. Take a small quantity of food item, grind to paste and add 10 drops of water to make a paste. To this add two drops of copper sulphate and ten drops of caustic soda. A violet colour indicates presence of protiens.

### Test for Fat
Take a small quantity of a food item.
Wrap it in a piece of paper and crush it. Take care that the paper does not tear. An oily patch on paper shows that the food item contains fat. The food items may sometimes contain a little water. Therefore, after you have rubbed an item on paper, let the paper dry for a while. If there were any water that may have come from food, it would dry up after some time. If no oily patch shows up after this, the food item does not contain any fat.

### What do various nutrients do for our body?
Carbohydrates mainly provide energy to our body. Fats also give us energy. In fact, fats give much more energy as compared to the same amount of carbohydrates. Foods containing  fats and carbohydrates are also called ‘energy giving foods’. Proteins are needed for the growth and repair of our body.Proteins are often called ‘body building foods’. Vitamins help in protecting our body against diseases. Vitamins also help in keeping our eyes, bones, teeth and gums healthy. Minerals are needed by our body in small amounts. Besides these nutrients, our body needs dietary fibres and water. Roughage does not provide any nutrient to our body but helps our body get rid of undigested food. Water helps our body to absorb nutrients from food. It also helps in throwing out some wastes from body as
urine and sweat.

### Balance Diet
For growth and maintenance of good health, our diet should have all the nutrients that our body needs, in right quantities.  The diet should also contain a good amount of roughage and water. Such a diet is called a balanced diet. It can be very harmful for us to eat too much of fat rich foods and we may end up suffering from a condition called obesity.

### Deficency Diseases
Diseases that occur due to lack of nutrients over a long period are called deficiency diseases. If a person does not get enough proteins in their food for a long time, they are likely to have stunted growth, swelling of face discolouration of hair, skin diseases and diarrhoea. If the diet is deficient in both carbohydrates and proteins for a long period of time, the growth may stop completely. Such a person becomes very lean and thin and so weak that he/she may not even be able to move. Deficiency of different vitamins and minerals may also result in certain diseases or disorders.
