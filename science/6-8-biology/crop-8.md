# Crop Production and Management - Reading

```
Same kind of plants cultivated at a place constitute a crop.
In India, crops can be broadly catergorised into two types based on seasons - rabi and kharif crops.
The crops which are sown in the rainy season are called kharif crops. The rainy season in India is generally from June to September. Paddy, maize, soyabean, groundnut and cotton are kharif crops.
The crops grown in the winter season (October to March) are called rabi crops. Examples of rabi crops are wheat, gram, pea, mustard and linseed.
Basic proceedures in crop production are:
(i) Preparation of soil
(ii) Sowing
(iii) Adding manure and fertilisers
(iv) Irrigation
(v) Protecting from weeds
(vi) Harvesting
(vii) Storage
It is necessary to prepare soil by tilling and levelling. Ploughs and levellers are used for this purpose.
Sowing of seeds at appropriate depths and distances gives good yield. Good variety of seeds are sown after selection of healthy seeds.
Sowing is done by seed drills.
Soil needs replenishment and enrichment through the use of organic manure and fertilisers. Use of chemical fertilisers has increased tremendously with the introduction of new crop varieties.
Supply of water to crops at appropriate intervals is called irrigation.
Weeding involves removal of unwanted and uncultivated plants called weeds.
Harvesting is the cutting of the mature crop manually or by machines.
Separation of the grains from the chaff is called threshing.
Proper storage of grains is necessary to protect them from pests and microorganisms.
Food is also obtained from animals for which animals are reared. This is called animal husbandry.
