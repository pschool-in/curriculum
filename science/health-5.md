Chapter - mahag5: Infectious Diseases and How to Prevent them
## Infectious Diseases and Prevention - Reading

### Infectious Diseases
One has to take care to stay away from people who are ill with the flu (influenza), cold, ringworm, scabies, chickenpox. These diseases spread from one person to the other. Such diseases are called infectious diseases.

They are caused by micro-organisms. Every infectious disease is caused by a specific micro-organism or germ. When the germs of a particular disease enter the body and begin to grow, the person gets the disease.

### Spread of infectious diseases
When a person has a cold, the germs from his body spread in the air when he coughs or sneezes. When these germs enter other people’s bodies, they can also get the disease. That is, the disease spreads. Typhoid spreads when its germs are passed on by a person ill with typhoid to another person.

Infections can be spread through air, water, food or insects.

### Spread of disease through air
The germs of a disease like influenza are present in the spit or saliva of the person who has the disease. When the person coughs or spits they enter the air with tiny droplets of saliva or spit. When other people breathe in that same air, the germs enter their bodies. Diseases of the throat and the chest spread through the air, for example, a cold and cough, tuberculosis, swine flu, etc. That is why we are told to cover our nose and mouth when we cough or sneeze.

### Spread of disease through water
The germs of diseases of the intestines like typhoid, cholera, diarrhea as also of jaundice, are present in the feces of the affected person. If the feces get mixed with water the germs in it also enter the water. If another person drinks water that has been contaminated by these germs, they enter his intestines too, and that person can get the disease. To prevent the spread of disease in this manner, it is best to avoid washing clothes and bathing in the water sources or defecating on the banks of the water.

### Spread of disease through food
Several people get diarrhea after consuming contaminated food. Diseases spread through food also. This is also called food poisoning. When flies sit on the feces of a person who has an intestinal disease, the germs of the disease stick to their legs. When the same flies sit on our food, the germs enter the food. If we eat that food, the germs enter our body and we can get the disease. That is why it is important to always keep our food covered. Food is handled while preparing or serving it. If someone who has an intestinal disease handles or serves food without washing his hands properly, the germs sticking to his hands can enter the food. Food contaminated in this way can also cause disease. One must avoid eating it. Maintaining cleanliness everywhere is beneficial for our health.

### The spread of disease by insects
You may be aware that one can get malaria from the bite of a certain kind of mosquito. When this type of mosquito bites someone who has malaria, the malaria germs in that person’s blood enter the mosquito’s body with the blood it sucks. If this mosquito bites another person, the malaria germs enter that person’s body too and he too can get malaria. Insects like mosquitoes, lice and fleas spread disease. That is why we must stop such insects from breeding.

### Spread of disease by direct contact
Ringworm, scabies are diseases that affect the skin. Their germs are found on the skin. If someone else comes in contact with the skin of a person having this disease or wears his clothes then that person can get that skin disease too. That is why it is better to avoid sharing clothes.

### An epidemic of a disease
Germs of diseases like the flu or conjunctivitis spread quickly through the air. So, many people can get such diseases all at one time. If the water of a common source is contaminated by germs of a disease like cholera, then there is the danger of all those who drink that water getting the disease. If at someplace, mosquitoes breed in large numbers then many people there can get malaria. When many people in one area get the same infectious disease all at the same time, we say that there is an epidemic of the disease.

### Prevention of infectious diseases
1. To prevent diseases from spreading through water, it is purified at the waterworks. 
2. In smaller towns and villages, bleaching powder is added to community sources of water to kill the germs and make the water safe for drinking. 
3. When there is an epidemic of gastro or jaundice, people are advised to boil water before drinking it.
4. To prevent mosquitoes from breeding, we must ensure there is no stagnant water in the surroundings. But, if that is not possible, insecticides have to be used. Thus diseases like malaria can be prevented.
5. People who have a serious infectious disease like tuberculosis or swine flu are quarantined. There are separate wards in hospitals for people with infectious diseases. Clothes and utensils used by the patients are washed with germicides. The spittle of a person who has tuberculosis is collected in a vessel and covered with a germicide-like phenyl. Such precautions help to prevent the disease from spreading to others.
6. To prevent the spread of diseases through the air, people should cover the mouth when sneezing or coughing and avoid spitting in the open. If it is necessary to be with such a patient, a mask should be worn to cover the nose and mouth.
7. If someone in the family gets an infectious disease, the government health department should be informed so that necessary steps for preventing the spread of the disease can be taken.

### Vaccination
When disease-producing micro-organisms enter our body, the body resists the disease or fights the germs. That is why many times we do not get a disease even if germs enter our body.

Another way to prevent disease is vaccination. Our body develops resistance to a particular disease due to vaccination. Soon after a baby is born, she is given the tuberculosis vaccine. When the baby is one and a half months old, she is given vaccinations against diphtheria, whooping
cough, tetanus and polio. Two more doses of these vaccinations are given at intervals of one month.

The vaccines for diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus are combined into a triple vaccine and given as an injection. The polio vaccine is given orally.
 
### Public health service facilities
To prevent the spread of infectious diseases and epidemics, health and
community welfare programs are undertaken at the national level.
Community programs for vaccination are also undertaken as part of
national health schemes. Children are given the vaccines by trained people. Special camps are arranged for this purpose. Primary Health Centres have been established at the village level. There are also facilities like mobile dispensaries, ambulances and a Welfare Fund for the
disabled. Services like the examination of urine and blood, X-ray, ultra-sound and other scans are also available through the health programs. Thus, patients can get the service they need without delay. 

People are also educated about the right methods of handling drinking water and food. They are urged to maintain cleanliness in their surroundings. It is now forbidden by law to spit in a public place. The purpose of this ban is to prevent the spread of diseases. Mass media are also used for raising public awareness about health and hygiene issues.

Chapter- mahag4: Community Health and Hygiene

## Community Health and Hygiene - Reading



### Community Health
Nutritious food, personal hygiene, exercise and pursuit of hobbies lead
to excellent health and good personal development. Just as we take care of our health, we must make efforts to ensure good health for all. Everyone in our society should be able to live the kind of tension-free and happy life that we wish for ourselves. 

Good community health and hygiene can be achieved through habits of
cleanliness and good health on the part of all individuals in a community.

Pollution, squalor, epidemics of infectious diseases, addiction, insect-borne diseases are all threats to community health. To nurture community health is to protect the general public from such diseases and to make a happy and healthy life possible for all.

### Importance of Community Health
The people of a country are the most important factor in a country’s progress and development. Their health can be protected if they have a clean environment, nutritious food, safe drinking water and good medical facilities.

Mass media are used under community welfare programs to educate people about issues such as taking care of drinking water and food. People are urged in every possible way to keep their surroundings clean. It is a legal offense to spit in public places. This ban aims to prevent the spread of diseases.

### Threats to Community Health
There are several threats to community health. An important threat is carelessness regarding hygiene. Some activities that may harm community health are: burning plastic, spitting in public, open defecation, improper disposal of garbage, contamination of water bodies, etc.

### Wholesome living
If we take care of our health, we can lead a wholesome life. Keeping ourselves happy and taking an interest in things, avoiding feelings of hatred and envy and doing what is necessary to maintain physical health helps us to achieve this end. If people of society live a healthy and wholesome life, social tensions also decrease and feelings
of friendship can be nurtured.

### Tobacco Consumption
Names of tobacco products such as gutka, cigarettes, bidis, masheri, mawa, pan masala, etc. are often heard. We also see many people consuming tobacco in different ways. All these are harmful to our health. 

At first, a person may chew tobacco casually at someone’s urging.
But this may lead to addiction. The person becomes dependent on tobacco and cannot give up the habit. When people develop this habit, they become restless if they do not get tobacco. They are not able to pay attention to anything else. They have to have tobacco in the mouth all the time. When the habit reaches this stage, it is called an addiction.

People addicted to tobacco spit here and there all the time and make their surroundings dirty.

### Ill effects of Tobacco
1. Ulcers in the mouth.
2. The ulcers develop into bigger wounds. The person may develop tumors.
3. A lot of time and money has to be spent on treatment. If the wounds do not heal, the person has serious problems. This can eventually lead to cancer.
4. Tobacco entering the digestive organs leads to complaints related to them.
5. The constant presence of tobacco in the digestive organs can cause cancer of any of those organs.
6. A person who develops cancer in this way has to take very painful treatment. Even after that, one cannot be sure that cancer will be cured.

### Alcoholism
Drinking alcohol also has adverse effects on the body. Alcohol addiction is called alcoholism.
1.  Alcohol makes a person drowsy and confused. One loses control over one’s actions.
2.  Alcoholism causes diseases of the liver, intestines and urinary bladder.
3.  Addiction to tobacco or alcohol is both very bad habits. 
The condition of the addict becomes pathetic, and the addict’s family has to suffer with them. There is no telling how much money will be required for treatment.
4. The family gets deprived of health and happiness and is ruined.
5.  We must be aware that an addict destroys the entire family.

### An Invitation to Death
Tobacco, drugs and alcohol produce a state of intoxication. Addiction to any of them eventually kills you.

Some people lure others into smoking, drinking, or trying out drugs. On no account should we give in to their pressure.

If a person starts getting addicted to smoking or drinking or taking drugs, the help of counselors or doctors should be sought immediately to rid the person of the habit.

One should eat regularly and take up sports and other hobbies. One should be firm in avoiding any addiction.
