# Passage - Speed

We are familiar with the term 'speed'. It is used to tell whether an object is
moving fast or slow. Higher speed means more distance is covered in short
duration. If you have a running race with your friend, the distance between the
starting and ending point will be fixed. Whoever covers the distance in the
short duration is the winner. If you both start at the same time then whoever
crosses the finishing line first is the winner.

A car moves faster than a cycle. And a cycle can move faster than a walking man.
A dog can move faster than a tortoise.

When we say that a car is moving with a speed of 50 kilometres per hour, it
implies that it will cover a distance of 50 kilometres in one hour. A car cannot
move at a constant speed. While starting, it will move slowly and gradually pick
up speed. If you apply break gently it won't come to a halt immediately. Instead
its speed will reduce gradually. So we shall use the term average speed.

If an object moves at a fixed speed then it is said to be having uniform motion.
Most of the real world motion are non uniform.

# True or False

```
True
Cars don't move at constant speed.
If the speed increases then the duration of travel decreases.
Speed of a car is usually measured as km per hour.

False
Most of the motions in real world are uniform.
It is not possible to calculate the speed of a moving train.

# Numberinput - find speed

```
distance | travel time | speed
100 | 2 | 50
120 | 6 | 20
300 | 4 | 75
120 | 4 | 30
1600 | 2 | 800
1800 | 3 | 600

# Passage - Measuring Time

Time can be measured in seconds, minute, hour, day, week, month, year, decade,
century.

Time can be denoted as an absolute point of reference or interval. Clock and
calendar show absolute time. A stop watch, count-down timer, sandclock shows
time interval.

## Working of a clock

The working of clocks is rather complex. But all of them make use of some
periodic motion. One of the most well-known periodic motions is that of a simple
pendulum.

A simple pendulum consists of a small metallic ball or a piece of stone
suspended from a rigid stand by a thread. The metallic ball is called the bob of
the pendulum.

When the bob of the pendulum is released after taking it slightly to one side,
it begins to move to and fro.

The to and fro motion of a simple pendulum is an example of a periodic or an
oscillatory motion.

The pendulum completes one oscillation when its bob moves from one extreme
position A to the other extreme position B and comes back to A. The time taken
by the pendulum to complete one oscillation is called its time period.

Through experiment we can find out the time period of a pendulum is constant.
Inspite of the displacement reducing with each oscillation.

In earlier days, most of the clock worked based on the time period of the
pendulum. Nowadays most clocks or watches have an electric circuit with one or
more cells. These clocks are called quartz clocks. The time measured by quartz
clocks is much more accurate than that older clocks.

Vehicles have a device to measure the distance moved by the vehicle. It is
called odometer. There is another device to measure the speed of the vehicle. It
is called speedometer.

# Distance-Time Graph

To study more about the speed, we can plot a graph between time and distance.
Time is marked along the x-axis and distance is marked along the y-axis.

For example, the distance-time graph of two cars are given above.

## Drag & Drop

```
The distance moved by an object in a unit time is called its *speed*.
To calculate the speed we need to divide the *kilometre* covered  by the *hours* travelled.
For *uniform* motion, the object should travel at a constant speed.
In olden times, we had *pendulum* clocks and nowadays we have *quartz* clocks.
```

```

The *time-period* of a pendulum is *constant*. The metallic ball of a pendulum is called *bob*.
The distance travelled by a vehicle is measured by *odometer* and the speed is measured by *speedometer*.
While drawing the distance-time graph, distance is marked along the *y-axis*, and time is marked along the *x-axis*.

## Group

```
Real Time
sundial, clock, watch, calendar

Time Interval
stopwatch, countdown timer, sandclock


```

## True or False

```
True
A graph drawn between distance and time, gives more information about the speed.
The time period of a pendulum will remain the same even if the pendulum slows down.
A decade means 10 years.
Quartz clocks are more accurate than the pendulum clocks.

False
Speed is always measured as km/hr.
It is possible to make a clock at home.
All cars move at the same speed.
