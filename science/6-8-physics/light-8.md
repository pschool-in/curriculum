# Passage - Laws of Reflection

We see different objects and the world around us through our eyes. But still we
need light to see them. We cannot see anything in the dark.

To see an object, light must be emitted or reflected by the object. Mirror
reflects the light that falls on it. Polished or shiny surface sometimes acts
like a mirror.

## A ray of light

A ray of light is an idealisation. In reality, we have a narrow beam of light
which is made up of several rays. For simplicity, we use the term ray for a
narrow beam of light.

## Incident & Reflected ray

After striking a mirror, a ray of light is reflected in another direction. The
light ray which strikes is called the incident ray. The light ray which reflects
is called the reflected ray. The perpendicular line drawn at the point of
incidence is called normal.

The angle between the normal and incident ray is called the angle of incidence.
(∠i). The angle between the normal and the reflected ray is known as the angle
of reflection. (∠r)

## Laws of Reflection

The law of reflection say that the angle of incidence is always equal to the
angle of reflection.

It also says, the incident ray, the normal at the point of incidence and the
reflected ray all lie in the same plane.

## Diffused Reflection

When parallel rays are incident on an irregular surface, we get irregular or
diffused reflection.

When parallel rays are incident on a regular surface like a mirror we get
regular reflection. Images are formed by regular reflection.

## Multiple Reflection

Multiple reflection is possible with the help of two or more mirrors. We could
have witnessed this in a hair dresser shop.

The idea of number of images formed by mirrors placed at an angle to one another
is used in a kaleidoscope to make numerous beautiful patterns.

# Passage - Working of Eye

Eye is one of the most important sense organs. Human eye is roughly spherical in
shape. The outer coat of the eye is white. It is tough so that it can protect
the interior of the eye from accidents. Its transparent front part is called
cornea. Behind the cornea, we find a dark muscular structure called iris. In the
iris, there is a small opening called the pupil. The size of the pupil is
controlled by the iris. The iris is the part of eye which gives its distinctive
colour. When we say that a person has green eyes, we refer actually to the
colour of the iris. The iris controls the amount of light entering into the eye.

Behind the pupil is a lens which is thicker in the center (convex lens). The
lens focuses light on the back of the eye, on a layer called retina. The retina
contains several nerve cells. Sensations felt by the nerve cells are then
transmitted to the brain through the optic nerve.

There are two kinds of cells.

1. cones, which are sensitive to bright light and
2. rods, which are sensitive to dim light.

Cones sense colour. At the junction of the optic nerve and the retina, there are
no sensory cells, so no vision is possible at the spot. This is called the blind
spot.

The impression of an image does not vanish immediately from the retina. It
persists for about 1/16th of a second. So, if still images of a moving object
are flashed on the eye at a rate faster than 16 per second, eye perceives this
object as moving.

Movies we see are a sequence of pictures shown usually at a rate of 24 picture
per second.

Nature has provided eyes with eyelids to prevent any object from entering the
eye. Eyelids also shut out light when not required.

The minimum distance at which the eye can see objects distinctly varies with
age. The most comfortable distance at which one can read with a normal eye is
about 25 cm. Some persons can see objects close to them clearly but cannot see
distant objects so clearly. On the other hand, some persons cannot see objects
nearby clearly but they can see distant objects quite well. With suitable
corrective lenses, these defects of the eye can be corrected.

Sometimes, particularly in old age, eyesight becomes foggy. When it happens,
persons are said to have cataract. There is a loss of vision, sometimes
extremely severe. It is possible to treat this defect. The opaque lens is
removed and a new artificial lens is inserted. Modern technology has made this
procedure simpler and safer.

## Eye Care

Too little light or too much light is bad for eyes. Insufficient light causes
eyestrain and headaches. Too much light, like Sun or powerful lamp can injure
the retina. Never rub your eyes hard. If particles of dust go into your eyes,
wash with clean water. Always read at the normal distance (25 cm).

## Do you know?

Eyes of a crab are quite small but they can look all around. Similarly
butterflies can look all around but their eyes are big.

Owl can see well in the night but not during the day. It has a large cornea and
a large pupil to allow more light. Also, its retina has large number of rods and
only a few cones.

On the other hand, birds like eagle can see will during the day but not in the
night. They have more cones and fewer rods in the retina.
