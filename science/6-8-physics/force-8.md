# Passage - Force

Force causes motion to objects. Force can be either a pull or push.

We can push a car, or we can lift a weight or we can throw a ball. Atleast two
objects must interact for a force to come into play. An interaction of one
object with another object results in a force between the two objects.

In the game of tug-of-war, two teams pull at a rope in opposite directions.
Sometimes the rope simply does not move. It means the forces from both
directions are the same. The team that pulls harder, applies a larger force and
wins the game.

Forces applied to an object in the same direction add to one another. If two
forces act in the opposite direction, the net force is the difference between
the two.

The strength of a force is usually expressed by its magnitude. Also, we have to
identify the direction in which the force acts. If the magnitude or direction of
the applied force changes, its effect also changes.

If more than one force acts on an object, the effect on the object is based on
the net force acting on it.

A body at rest can be brought to motion by applying force. A body in motion can
be brought to rest by applying force in the opposite direction.

A change in either the speed of an object, or its direction of motion, or both,
is described as a change in its state of motion. Thus, a force may bring a
change in the state of motion of an object.

Not every force results in a change in the state of motion. For example, if we
apply force and push a wall, nothing with happen.

Applying force to chapati dough, will change its shape.

# Passage - Types of Forces

Forces are broadly classified into contact and non-contact forces. Muscular
force and friction are examples of contact forces. Magnetic, electro-static and
gravitational forces are examples of non-contact forces.

## muscular force

When we push an object like a school bag or lift a bucket of water, where does
the force come from? This force is caused by the action of muscles in our body.
The force resulting due to the action of muscles is known as the muscular force.

Animals like bullocks, horses, donkeys and camels are used to perform various
tasks for us using their muscular force.

## Friction

A ball rolling along the ground gradually slows down and finally comes to rest.
When we stop pedaling a bicycle, it gradually slows down and finally comes to a
stop. A car or a scooter also comes to rest once its engine is switched off.
Similarly, a boat comes to rest if we stop rowing it. All these happen because
of friction.

The force of friction always acts on all the moving objects and its direction is
always opposite to the direction of motion. Since the force of friction arises
due to contact between surfaces, it is also an example of a contact force.

## Magnetic Force

Take a pair of bar magnets. Place the longer side of one of the magnets over
three round-shaped pencils. Now bring one end of the other magnet near the end
of the magnet placed on the roller. The magnet on the roller will either move
towards or away.

Magnets exert forces on one another even if they don't touch each other.
Magnetic force is an example of a non-contact force.

## Electrostatic Force

Take a plastic straw and cut it into nearly two equal pieces. Suspend one of the
pieces from the edge of a table with the help of a piece of thread.

Now hold the other piece of straw in your hand and rub its free end with a sheet
of paper. Bring the rubbed end of the straw near the suspended straw. Make sure
that the two pieces do not touch each other.

A straw is said to have acquired an electrostatic charge after it has been
rubbed with a sheet of paper. Such a straw is an example of a charged body. The
force exerted by a charged body on another charged or uncharged body is known as
electrostatic force. This force comes into play even when the bodies are not in
contact. The electrostatic force, therefore, is another example of a non-contact
force.

## Gravity

You know that a coin or a pen falls to the ground when it slips off your hand.
Leaves and fruits also fall to the ground when they get detached from the plant.
Objects or things fall towards the earth because it pulls them. This force is
called the force of gravity, or just gravity. This is an attractive force. Water
in rivers flows downward due to the force of gravity.

Gravity is not a property of the earth alone. Every object in the universe,
whether small or large, exerts a force on every other object. This force is
known as the gravitational force. Earth moves around the Sun and the moon moves
around the Earth due to gravitational force.

# Drag & Drop

The strength of a force is usually expressed by its *magnitude*. The effect of more than one force acting on an object depends on its *net force*. A rolling ball comes to rest due to *friction*. Leaves fall from the tree due to *gravity*. Muscular force is an example for *contact* force and magnetic force is an example for *non-contact* force.

# Passage - Pressure

Strong winds during a storm or a cyclone can blow away even the rooftops. You
also learned that winds and cyclones are caused by differences in air pressure.

Try cutting vegetables with a blunt knife and then with a sharp knife. Which is
easier?

Try to push a nail into a wooden plank by its head and by the pointed end. Which
will work?

The area over which the force is applied plays a role in making these tasks
easier. The force acting on a unit area of a surface is called pressure.

pressure = force / area on which it acts

At this stage, we consider only those forces which act perpendicular to the
surface on which the pressure is to be computed.

Porters place a round piece of cloth on their heads, when they have to carry
heavy loads. By doing this they increase the area of contact of the load with
their head. So, the pressure on their head is reduced and they find it easier to
carry the load.

Smaller the area, larger the pressure on a surface for the same force. The area
of the pointed end of the nail is much smaller than that of its head. The same
force, therefore, produces a pressure sufficient to push the pointed end of the
nail into the wooden plank.

Shoulder bags are provided with broad straps so that the weight is spread over
the area. Tools meant for cutting and piercing always have sharp edges.

## Liquids and Gases

Liquid and gases exert pressure on the walls of the container. When we blow a
balloon, the air inside the balloon will be denser than the atmospheric air. As
the air inside the balloon pushes the wall, the balloon will stretch. If we put
a hole in a balloon, the air forces out.

## Atmospheric Pressure

The atmospheric air extends up to many kilometres above the surface of the
earth. The pressure exerted by this air is known as atmospheric pressure.

The force due to air in a column of the height of the atmosphere and area 15 cm
Ã— 15 cm (top area of our head) is nearly equal to the force of gravity on an
object of mass 225 kg (2250N). The reason we are not crushed under this force of
gravity is that the pressure inside our bodies is also equal to the atmospheric
pressure and balances the pressure from outside.
