# Passage - Story of Transport

Long ago people did not have any means of transport. They used to move only on
foot and carry goods on their back. Later on, they began to use animals for
transportation.

For transport through water routes, boats were used from ancient times. To begin
with, boats were simple logs of wood in which a hollow cavity could be made.
Later, people learnt to put together different pieces of wood and give shapes to
the boats.

The invention of the wheel made a great change in modes of transport. The design of
the wheel was improved over thousands of years. Animals were used to pull carts
that moved on wheels.

Until the beginning of the 19th century, people still depended on animals, boats
and ships to transport them from place to place. The invention of steam engine
led to the development of new means of transport. Railroads were made for steam
engine driven carriages and wagons.

Later came automobiles such as motor cars, trucks and buses. Motorised boats and
ships were used as means of transport on water. The early years of 1900 saw the
development of aeroplanes. These were later improved to carry passengers and
goods. Electric trains, monorail, supersonic aeroplanes and spacecraft are some
of the contributions of the 20th century.

# Passage 2 - Measuring Length

The tailor needs to measure the length of the cloth to know if it is enough to
stitch a shirt. A carpenter needs to measure the height and width of a cupboard
to know how much wood he would need to make its door. The farmer needs to know
the length and breadth or the area of his land to know how much seed he can sow
and how much water would be needed for his crops.

Suppose, you are asked how tall you are? You want to tell the length of a
straight line from the top of your head to the heel of your feet.

Measuring length is about the distance between two points or places. The two
places maybe close enough, like the two ends of a table or they may be far
apart, like Jammu and Kanyakumari.

In ancient times, the length of a foot, the width of a finger, and the distance
of a step were commonly used as different units of measurements. Even today, we
can see flower sellers using their forearm as a unit of length for garlands in
many towns of India. Unfortunately, all these measurement varies from people to
people.

For the sake of uniformity, scientists all over the world have accepted a set of
standard units of measurement. The system of units now used is known as the
International System of Units (SI units). The SI unit of length is a metre.

Each metre (m) is divided into 100 equal divisions, called centimetre (cm). Each
centimetre has ten equal divisions, called millimetre (mm). For measuring large
distances, we use killometer(km), which is 1000 times the metre. Measuring the
length of a curved line cannot be done using a scale.

We can use a thread to measure the length of a curved line. Place the thread
along the curve and them measure the length of the thread.

# Passage 3 - Types of Motion

Vehicles move along a straight road. Soldiers march along a straight line. If
you drop a stone from a height it reaches the ground by moving in a straight
line. All these motions are called rectilinear motion.

If we tie a thread to a stone and whirl it with our hand, the stone moves along
a circular path. The distance between the stone and hand remains the same as the
length of the thread. This type of motion is called rotational motion. The
rotation of blades in a fan, or hands in a clock are other examples.

In some cases, an object repeats its motion after some time. This type of motion
is called periodic motion. The motion of a pendulum, swing in the park, strings
of a guitar, membrane of drums are all examples of periodic motion.

If you observe a sewing machine, its wheel moves in a circular motion but the
needle that moves up and down continuously is periodic motion.

A ball moving along the ground has both rectilinear and rotational motion.

Motion is a change in the position of an object with time. The change in this
position can be determined through distance measurements. We can see how fast or
slow a motion is. We can measure the speed of a moving snail, flying butterfly,
flowing river, flying aeroplane, moon around the Earth etc.

# Drag & Drop

```
Measuring length is about the *distance* between two *points*. Flower sellers use *forearm* to measure garlands. In older days, measurements *vary* with people.
Curved lines can be measured with the help of *thread*. Tailors use *tapes* for measuring clothes. Students can measure the length of a pencil using a *scale*.


Motion is a change in the *position* of an object with *time*. Change in position can be determined by measuring *distance*. How fast an object moves is measured by *speed*.
In a sewing machine, the wheel moves in *rotational* motion and the needle move in a *periodic* motion.
