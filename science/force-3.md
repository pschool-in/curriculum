### Force: Push and Pull

In everyday life, we push or pull things to move them. A push or pull is called force. This force helps us to do many things. It can make an object move. It can  stop a moving object. 
It can change the shape of an object, change the speed of the moving object and change the size of the object. There are different types of forces that act on a body. 
  
When you throw a ball up, no matter how high it goes, it is sure to come down. This is because of gravitational force. This force attracts objects to the center of the earth. 
 
When two objects touch each other, a special type of force develops between them. This special force is called friction. Friction slows down movements. When friction is very less, things move easily. When friction is more, it becomes difficult to move things. A wet floor is slippery because there is very little friction. Friction makes it possible for you to write. You cannot hold a pencil in your hand without friction. It would slip out from your hands. The pencil cannot make a mark on the paper without friction.

## Push and Pull

Drag and drop: Classify push and pull.

Push - kicking a ball, Switching on light, pedaling cycle

Pull - putting on gloves, lifting weights



## Types of Force

At a broad level, force can be classified into contact and non-contact forces.

### Contact Force

When a force is applied by touching the object, it is called contact force.
eg: lighting a match stick, throwing a ball.

### Non-Contact Force

When a force is applied without touching the object, it is called non-contact force.
Eg. Vaccum cleaner, magnet, gravitation

### Muscular Force

The force applied by using parts of our body is called muscular force.

We use our legs to pedal our bicycle. We use our hands to make some model from clay.

### Mechanical Force

The force applied by a machine is called mechanical force.
Eg: Using bulldozer to dig ground. Grinding using a mixer grinder.

### Gravitational Force

The Earth pulls all the objects towards itself. The force applied by the Earth to pull objects towards itself is called gravitational force.

### Magnetic Force

A magnet is a material that attracts things made of iron. The force that attracts things is called magnetic force.

### Frictional Force

When we roll down a ball on grass ground, it slows down and finally stops. We know that an object cannot stop without force. The force that stopped the ball is frictional force. Force exerted by the surface when an object moves over it is called Frictional force.

When we use eraser on a paper, the shape of the eraser changes. It is because of the friction between the erasor and the paper.

Friction is a force between two surfaces in contact or when they slide over one another.

Early man accidentally discovered fire by rubbing two flint stones together. The frictional force between two stones created a spark.

If you put your palm together and rub them against each other. You can feel the heat on your palm.
