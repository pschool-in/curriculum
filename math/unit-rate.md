What is Rate?

A rate is a ratio that compares two quantities with different units of measure.

Example 1

3 Pens cost ₹ 15.

The ratio between money and pens is 15 is to 3.

Example 2

I can write 8 pages in 2 hours.

The ratio between pages and hours is 8 is to 2.

Example 3

A plane flew 1000 km in 4 hours.

The ratio between kilometers and hours is 1000 is to 4.

Now, let us see what Unit Rate is.

A unit rate of two quantities in a ratio is the number of units of the first
quantity for every 1 unit of the second quantity.

We have to divide the first quantity by the second.

Let's get back to our first example. If we divide 15 by 3, we get 5.

In other words, the ratio 15 is to 3 can be simplified as 5 is to 1.

It means, one pen costs ₹ 5.

In our example 2, If we divide 8 by 2, we get 4.

In other words, the ratio 8 is to 2 can be simplified as 4 is to 1.

It means, I can write 4 pages in 1 hour.

In our example 3, If we divide 1000 by 4, we get 250.

In other words, the ratio 1000 is to 4 can be simplified as 250 is to 1.

It means, the plane flew 250 km in 1 hour.

Let us practice some problems based on this.
