define active and passive voice

Active voice and passive voice are two different ways of constructing sentences
in English, depending on the subject's relationship to the action being
performed.

Active Voice: In active voice sentences, the subject of the sentence is the doer
of the action. It emphasizes the agent or the performer of the action. The
structure of an active voice sentence is generally: Subject + Verb + Object.

Example: Active Voice: "John ate an apple."

In this sentence, "John" is the subject, "ate" is the verb, and "an apple" is
the object. The subject (John) is performing the action (eating) directly.
Passive Voice: In passive voice sentences, the subject of the sentence receives
the action rather than performing it. It emphasizes the receiver or the target
of the action. The structure of a passive voice sentence is generally: Object +
Verb (past participle) + by + Subject (optional).

Example: Passive Voice: "The apple was eaten by John."

In this sentence, "the apple" is the object, "was eaten" is the passive verb
construction (past participle of "eat" with the auxiliary verb "was"), and "by
John" indicates the doer of the action. The subject (the apple) is receiving the
action (being eaten) instead of performing it. It's important to note that not
all sentences can be transformed into the passive voice, as it depends on the
presence of a suitable direct object in the active voice sentence. Additionally,
the passive voice may be used to shift the focus or emphasize the object or the
action itself rather than the doer.
