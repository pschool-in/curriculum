explain direct and indirect speech in detail

Direct and indirect speech are two ways to report or convey someone's words or
speech. They are used when we want to quote or relay what someone has said.
Let's explore each of these forms in detail:

Direct Speech: Direct speech involves directly quoting the exact words spoken by
someone. In direct speech, the person's words are enclosed within quotation
marks and are reported using the original speaker's tense and pronouns. Here's
an example: Original statement: "I am going to the store," said John.

Direct speech: John said, "I am going to the store."

In direct speech, the sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a
punctuation mark (usually a comma or a full stop) inside the closing quotation
mark.

Key points to remember about direct speech:

The exact words spoken are enclosed in quotation marks. The tense and pronouns
of the original speaker are maintained. The reporting verb (e.g., said, replied,
shouted) is used to introduce the quote. The sentence structure may need to be
adjusted to fit the reporting verb and the quote. Indirect Speech (also known as
Reported Speech): Indirect speech involves paraphrasing or reporting someone's
words without using their exact words. In indirect speech, the reported
statement is no longer enclosed in quotation marks, and the tense, pronouns, and
other elements are often adjusted to fit the reporting context. Here's an
example: Original statement: "I am going to the store," said John.

Indirect speech: John said that he was going to the store.

In indirect speech, the verb used to introduce the reported speech is usually
changed from the present tense to the past tense, and the pronouns are adjusted
accordingly. The sentence structure may also need to be modified.

Key points to remember about indirect speech:

The reported statement is not enclosed in quotation marks. The tense, pronouns,
and other elements are adjusted based on the reporting context. The reporting
verb is usually changed to the past tense. The sentence structure may need to be
modified. It's important to note that the choice between direct and indirect
speech depends on the context and the writer's intention. Direct speech is used
when we want to quote someone verbatim or emphasize their exact words. Indirect
speech is used when we want to report someone's words in our own words or when
the focus is on the content of the speech rather than the exact phrasing.

Additionally, it's worth mentioning that reported questions and requests follow
similar rules as reported speech, with changes in word order, pronouns, and verb
tenses.
