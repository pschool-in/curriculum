# MarkDown

MarkDown (or Mark Up) are special type of computer language used to write 'rich
text' features in 'plain text'.

HTML is a very famous one used in building websites.

Even whatsapp supports some types of markdown features.

(Note: Not all computer languages are programming languages. )

## Title

```
# Top level title (usually Playlist name)
## Second level title (using Activity label)
### Third level title (used within an activity)
(We don't use more than three levels of titles)
```

## Bold and italic

We need to enclose the text within asterrisk `*` for italic and double asterisk
`**` for bold.

This is only for github. It may be different for other apps. For example in
whatsapp, it is asterrisk `*` for bold and underscore `_` for italics.

While creating content for PSchool, we rarely use bold and italics.

## Lists

It can be numbered list or bulletted list.

```
1. one
2. two
3. three
```

1. one
2. two
3. three

```
- one
- two
- three
```

- one
- two
- three

# No lines. Only paragraphs.

Line breaks are ignored in markdown. Paragraphs can be created by leaving an
empty line.

As different screens have different width, wordwrap defines the lines.

## Code Block

Code Block is a widely used style in PSchool. It helps in preserving the
characters as it is.

We know charecters like `#`, `*` etc have special meaning and we cannot use them
as it is.

In case if we want to use them, or if we decide to use line breaks, we enclose
them between three back-ticks (```)

Note: Single back-tick is used for the same purpuse but inline.

# Block vs Inline style

Heading, List are block styles. Bold, italic, underline are inline styles.

# Short Note on Github.

Github is a widely used tool amoung software developers. It is nothing but a
place to keep shared folders, so that multiple people can work on the same set
of files.

A shared folder is known as repo or repository. It is very similar to google
drive shared folder. And we can add lot of files.

Readmd.md is a special type of file, and its content will be displayed by
default.
