# Playlist

Simply put, Playlist is a collection of activities.

It looks more like a Table of Content (TOC).

Activities can be given as singular or as a group.

# Unique

Every playlist has a unique id, and they are readily accessible by the below
url.

```
www.pschool.in/<playlist-id>
```

Before starting the work, the Content Developer should identify their playlist
and work on them.

Each playlist has a separate file. The file name should match with the playlist
id.

When we get more content in a playlist, we will split them into multiple
playlists. (For eg, we splitted antonyms into antonyms-1, antonyms-2,
antonyms-3)

# Customization

PSchool users can create their own playlist and share it with their students.
They can either create activities from scratch or they can pluck activites from
other playlists.
