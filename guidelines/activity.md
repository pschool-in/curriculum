# Activity

Activity is the basic building block for PSchool. We have different types of
activities, and we will build more types of actvities in future.

The Content Developer should have good understanding about the different types
of activities we have. While preparing the content, they have to clearly specify
the activity type.

# Template

We made some of the activities into templates so that they are easily customizable
and any user can create their own content.

Most of the activities have label and instruction text.

# Label

1. Labels will be displayed on the TOC (Table of Content) of the playlist.
2. Should be ideally between 2-5 words. Usually not a complete sentence.
3. Avoid generic Labels, if possible. Eg:
   1. Fill in the blanks
   2. Match the Following
   3. Multiple Choice Questions
4. Provide some context in the label, if possible. Eg:
   1. Match: Antonyms
   2. MCQ: Leaders of India
   3. Fill up: Rhyming word
5. If possible, ensure there is an action word (Verb). Match, Fill up, Drag and Drop - are actions.
   1. 'Multiple Choice Questions' can be 'Choose the Best Answer'.

# Instruction

Instruction text appears on the activity page after you click on the label. It has to be a complete sentence, and clearly explain what the user has to do.
