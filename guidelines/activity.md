# Activity

Activity is the basic building block for PSchool. We have different types of
activities, and we will build more types of actvities in future.

The Content Developer should have good understanding about the different types
of activities we have. While preparing the content, they have to clearly specify
the activity type.

# Template

We made some of the activities into templates so that they are easy customizable
and any user can create their own content.
