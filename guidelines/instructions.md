- Use simple language. If there is a lengthy sentence then break it.
- For science, always try to use simple present tense. Use other tenses only if
  they are abosolutely necessary.
- Play it safe. We may not be a real expert and we may not be 100% sure. In that
  case, try to avoid the content where we may get into trouble. Be it either
  factual issue or grammatical issue.
- Spend enough time in doing self review.
