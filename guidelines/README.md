This is still a work in progress documentation.

In PSchool, we keep the Development and Content team independent of each other.
And we want to keep the content as open source.

The below pages talks more about the product and process.

## Content Developer

- Every activity is a template. Know more about some of the common and widely
  used [Templates](../templates.md)
- We are basically a tech company. But sometimes we may have to work with
  content developers who are not familiar with MarkDown or playlist structure.
  We have a [Workflow](workflow.md) in such cases.
- [Playlist](playlist.md) is a very important core concept in PSchool.
- [Curriculum](curriculum.md) defines the boundary for a course or a mini course
  or a class.
- There are a set of [General Instructions](instructions.md) we should always
  keep in mind.

## Playlist Developer

Content developers can slowly learn some of the semi-technical stuff.

- The first thing to learn in the list is, understanding
  [Plain Text](rich-vs-plain-text.md)
- Understanding [Markdown](markdown.md) will take you to the next level.
- [Activity](activity.md)

- [Dev Notes](dev-notes.md)
