## Chapter: mahag3: Public Services for Community Life
## Public Services - Reading
### Community Life
In a home, we live with our family. Our life outside the home is our public life. Several services are required for public life to go on smoothly. Public facilities are those services that are available to all of us. We use several such services like transport, schools and hospitals. Public services are equally available to all and are meant for everybody. We must use them responsibly.

### Local Government 
We live in cities or villages. The population of cities is large whereas, in
villages, it is quite small. In cities, there are factories, markets and greater chances for employment. Cities have public services on a large scale.
The administration of a place, be it a city or a village, is run by the government in that place. It is known as local government.

A gram panchayat runs the administration of a village.

A municipality runs the administration of a town and for big cities, there is
a municipal corporation.

### Public Services
Public services are provided to us out of the money collected from us as taxes. We must use them carefully. The local government provides the services of water supply and public hygiene. The postal service is useful for keeping in touch with our friends and relatives. Letters can be sent to any part of the world.

### Co-Operatives
The people in a locality sometimes come together and find out what the local needs are. Based on their findings, they decide to start an industry or service in co-operation with one other. They contribute some of their own money to start that industry or service. The profits are distributed among everyone. Institutions formed by people’s cooperation are called co-operatives.

## Chapter: tn-3-1-social: Panchayat
## Panchayat - Reading
## Panchayat
Ours is a vast country. It has towns and villages. Therefore, many panchayats must exist. Village Panchayat is the root of the Panchayat Raj system. It provides the basic facilities for the village people. The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act was passed by the Parliament in April 1993. The Amendment‛s salient feature is the three-tier system of Panchayat Raj. Panchayats have been set up in every village with 500 people and above.

### Members 
There is a President (head of the Panchayat) and a Vice President along with ward members (6-15). Village people select the president and members through the election. There is one election every five years.

### Duties 
The duties of the panchayat are:
1. Providing electricity and maintaining the street lights.
2. Construction and maintenance of village wells.
3. Providing drinking water.
4. Constructing roads and maintaining them.
5. Setting up sewage channels.
6. Constructing small bridges.
7. Repairing Primary School buildings.
8. Providing sanitation facilities.

Our central and state governments provide money to the panchayat. We pay taxes to the panchayat. Panchayat uses this money for the development of the village. Collecting tax is an obligatory function of a panchayat.
They do some optional functions too. Such as,
1. Planting trees on either side of the roads
2. Setting up and maintenance of public markets
