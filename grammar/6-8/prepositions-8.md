## Prepositions - Reading
A preposition is a word that joins nouns, pronouns or phrases to other words in a sentence. It usually shows the relationship of those words or phrases with other words in the sentence about space, time or reason. A preposition usually comes before a noun. When a preposition is not followed by a noun, it is often called a  stranded preposition.

A stranded preposition comes at the end of a sentence when its  object is a relative pronoun or an interrogative pronoun (words like  that, who, which, etc.)

Prepositions can be categorized into three based on their form:
1. Simple Prepositions: Single-word prepositions are called simple prepositions. Some examples are in, on, at, by, from, about, over, under, through, till, up, off, of, for, to, etc.
2. Compound Prepositions: When two or more words are combined to form one single preposition, we have a compound preposition. Some examples of compound prepositions are 
into, across, without, within, inside, outside, beneath, below, behind,  between, etc.
3. Complex or Phrase Prepositions: When a group of words does the work of a single preposition, it is called a complex or phrase preposition. Some two-word complex prepositions are along with, according to, apart from, because of, contrary to, regardless of, prior to, due to, except for, etc.

### Collocation
Certain nouns, adjectives and verbs are generally used with specific prepositions in such a way that these have become fixed ways of using these words. We often refer to such combinations as collocations. Some examples are fondness for, participation in, afraid of, find out, care for, etc.

### Prepositional Phrase
A prepositional phrase can have the functions of an adjective or an adverb.

### Complete the passage
Complete the passage using appropriate prepositions
```
Belgium and Denmark are only an hour or so apart *by* airplane. Danes look a lot like Belgians, and if you were dropped *on* a street corner *in* Copenhagen, you wouldn’t find it all that different *from* a street corner *in* Brussels. 

*In* the mid-1990s, an experimental public school called the KIPP Academy opened *on* the fourth floor of Lou Gehrig Junior High School *in* New York City. Lou Gehrig is *in* the seventh school district, one of the poorest neighborhoods *in* New York City.

Now take a look *at* the last column, which totals up all the summer gains *from* first grade *to* sixth grade. The reading scores of the poor kids go up *by* 0.19 points. When it comes to reading skills, poor kids learn nothing when school is not *in* session. The reading scores of the rich kids, by contrast, go up *by* a whopping 60.99 points. Virtually all of the advantage that wealthy students have over poor students is the result of differences in the way privileged kids learn *while* they are not *in* school.

One very real possibility is that these are the educational consequences of the differences *in* parenting styles. Think back to Alex Williams, the nine-year-old whom Annette Lareau studied. His parents believe *in* concerted cultivation. He gets taken *to* museums and gets enrolled *in* special programs and goes *to* summer camp, where he takes classes. When he’s bored *at* home, there are plenty of books to read, and his parents see it as their responsibility to keep him actively engaged *in* the world *around* him. It’s hard to see how Alex would get better *at* reading and math *over* the summer.
