## Verb - Reading

The verb is a word that expresses some action, feeling or existence. It tells us something about the subject.
Examples: Lions roar. (action); Boys fly kites. (action); I feel sorry. (feeling); Ashoka was a great king. (existence)
Verbs are divided in two parts; Main Verbs and Helping Verbs.
Main verbs are also of two kinds:

1. Finite Verb: They change their forms according to the person and number of the subject and the tense also.
   Example: He reads. I read.
2. Non-finite Verb: They do not change their forms according to the number, person or tense of the subject. The infinitives, gerunds and participles are called non-finite verbs.
