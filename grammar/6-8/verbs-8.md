## Linking Verb - Reading
Linking verbs are verbs that don’t show an action but rather describe the subject. While verbs like walk or jump represent an action, linking verbs like be or seem add more details to the subject, such as 'he seems nice' or 'she is an architect'.
All basic forms of the ‘to be’ verb can be used as linking verbs to qualify the state of being of the subject.
All forms of the verb ‘to seem’ are used as linking verbs.
All forms of the verb ‘to become’ are used as linking verbs.
