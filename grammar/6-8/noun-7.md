## Noun - Reading

Nouns are words used to refer to objects, places and living things. Some nouns also refer to feelings and emotions. Nouns can be divided into several categories:

1. Common Noun: A common noun is a general, ordinary name of a person, place, animal, thing or event.
2. Proper Noun: A name used for an individual person, place, or organization, spelled with an initial capital letter.
3. Collective Noun: Used for a collection of people or things.
4. Abstract Noun: Describes a concept, feeling or emotion.
5. Countable Noun: Anything that can be counted with numbers is called countable nouns.
6. Uncountable Noun: Anything that cannot be counted is known as an uncountable noun.
7. Singular Noun: A noun that consists of only one person, animal, or thing is called a singular noun.
8. Plural Noun: A noun that is having more than one person, place, thing, or animal is called a plural noun.
9. Masculine Noun: A noun that refers to the ‘male’ is called a masculine noun. The word masculine means male, so all the words with male gender, be it a person’s name, an animal’s name, or a bird’s name, it is all said to be masculine.
10. Feminine Noun: A noun that refers to the ‘female’ is called a feminine noun. The word feminine means female, so all the words with female gender, be it a person’s name, an animal’s name or a bird’s name, it is all said to be feminine.
11. Common Gender Noun: A noun that belongs to both males and females.
