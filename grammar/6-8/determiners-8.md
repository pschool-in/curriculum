## Determiner - Reading

A word that determines or limits a noun or a noun phrase is a determiner. Determiners can be divided into two broad categories: specific and general.

Specific determiners are used in noun phrases to talk about or indicate specific people or things.
Examples: the, this, that, these, those, my
our, your, his, her, its, their
We cannot use more than one specific determiner before a noun.

General determiners are used to talk about people or things in a general or indefinite way.
Examples: a, an, one, every, many, more
most, much, little, few, either, neither
nо, other, each, some, both, any
enough, all, another, several

Determiners are divided into three main groups:

1. central determiners (the articles and other words such as my, this, and some that also function as pronouns)
2. predeterminers (all, both, twice, such)
3. post determiners ( many, few, several).

Determiners include the following:

1. articles: Definite (The), Indefinite (A and An), Zero Article
2. possessive adjectives (my, our, your, his, her, their)
3. demonstrative adjectives (this, that, these, those)
4. distributives (each, every, either, neither)
5. quantifiers (a few, a little, much, more, some, etc.) and numbers (one, two, forty, second, twenty-fourth, etc.)
6. interrogative adjectives (what, whose, which)
