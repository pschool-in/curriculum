## Determiners - Reading

Determiners are words that introduce nouns. They tell us whether the noun phrase is specific or general. Determiners are either specific or general.

1. The specific determiners are =>
   · the definite article: the
   · possessives: my, your, his, her, its; our, their, whose
   · demonstratives: this, that, these, those
   · interrogatives: which
   We use a specific determiner when we believe the listener/reader knows exactly what we are referring to.
2. The general determiners are a; an; any; another; other; what.
   When we are talking about things in general and the listener/reader does not know exactly what we are referring to.
   => We can use a singular noun with the indefinite article 'a' or 'an'.
   Examples: A woman was lifted to safety by a helicopter.
   A man climbing nearby saw the accident.
   => We use the general determiner 'any' with a singular noun or an uncountable noun when we are talking about all of those people or things:
   Examples: It’s very easy. Any child can do it.
   With a full license, you are allowed to drive any car.
   I like beef, lamb, pork - any meat.
   => We use the general determiner 'another' to talk about an additional person or thing:
   Examples: Would you like another glass of wine?
   The plural form of another is other:
   I spoke to John, Helen and a few other friends.

## Types of Determiners

1. Articles: Articles can be definite articles (the) or indefinite (a or an). 'The' is used when the speaker thinks that the listener already knows what is being referred to. Otherwise, 'a' (before consonants) or 'an' (before vowels) is used.
   Examples: I bought a nice present for my uncle.
   There's an otter over there.
   The beaches in Goa are beautiful.
   I'll give you an example of the essay question.
2. Demonstratives: Demonstrative determiners are used to identify or point to a particular person, event, or object. 'This' and 'that' is singular. 'These' and 'those' are plural.
   Examples: I like this kind of biscuit.
   Why don't you buy that book instead of this one?
   Those children outside are being too noisy for this time of night.
   I'll take these pills for my backache later.
3. Possessive Adjectives: Possessive adjective determiners function as adjectives rather than pronouns. As they are adjectives, they appear before the noun that they are modifying.
   Examples: Do you like _my_ new dress?
   I prefer _my_ uniform to _yours_.
   Take _your_ phone out of _your_ pocket.
4. Quantifiers: Quantifiers provide approximate or specific answers to the questions "How many?" and "How much?"
   Examples: I only take _a little_ bit of milk with my tea.
   Quite _a few_ people should be coming to the party.
   I didn't take _many_ holidays last year.
   I haven't brought _much_ money with me.
   Do you think _a lot of_ people believe what he says?
   _Most_ students work hard to pass their exams.
   Have you got _any_ proof that he committed the crime?
   It takes _some_ effort for me to do exercise.
   Do we have _enough_ rice to last the week?
5. Numbers: Numbers are either cardinal (one, two, three, etc.), which are adjectives referring to quantity, or ordinal (first, second, third, etc.) referring to distribution.
   Examples: Two cars are enough for most families.
   There are about twenty-five people in my office.
   It's my fortieth birthday next week.
   That is the second time you've done that!
6. Distributives: Distributive determiners are used to refer to a group or individual members of the group. They reveal more about how people or things are distributed, shared, or divided.
   Examples: _Both_ countries need to discuss the issues and find a solution.
   _All_ pet dogs need plenty of attention.
   _Half_ the people decided not to vote.
   _Neither_ house is suitable for our needs.
   We can eat at _either_ 7 pm or 8 pm.
7. Interrogatives: Interrogatives are used to ask questions. 'Which' as a determiner is used to ask about a specific group of people or things. 'What' as a determiner is used when we are asking a general question. 'Whose' is used to ask a question about possession.
   Examples: Which restaurant did you like best?
   What time will you come?
   Whose pencil is this?

## Rules

The grammar rules for determiners are:

1. They always come before a noun.
2. They come before any modifiers (e.g. adjectives) used before the noun.
3. They are required before a singular noun.
4. They are optional before plural nouns.
