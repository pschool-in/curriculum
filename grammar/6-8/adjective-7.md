## Adjective - Reading

A word that is used with a noun or a pronoun to describe it (description may be of its type, place, number or amount) is known as an Adjective.
Example: Ramesh is intelligent.
An intelligent boy won the quiz.
In both sentences, ‘intelligent’ is used to describe the quality of nouns so it is an adjective in both sentences.
=> In the first sentence, ‘intelligent’ is used as a part of the predicate, so it is called a predicative adjective.
In the second sentence, ‘intelligent’ is used to describe the attribute of the noun, so it is called an attributive adjective.
=> Some adjectives like ‘afraid’, ‘well’ etc can be used only predicatively.

## Kinds of Adjectives

Adjectives are of three kinds:

1. Adjective of Quantity: It shows how much of anything is described.
   e.g. She has ‘some’ time.
   Sheela has ‘little’ patience.
2. Adjective of Number (Numeral Adjective): It shows how many persons or things are described. It also shows the order of any person or thing.
   e.g.There are ‘three’ halls in the palace.
   ‘All’ students will pass this year.
3. Adjective of Quality: It shows the kind of quality of any person or thing. (ie.., it describes the attribute of any person or thing)
   e.g. Sapna is an ‘honest’ girl.
   You are a ‘foolish’ man.

## Comparisson of Adjectives

Here are some examples of adjectives in their different degrees of comparison:

1. Positive: It is the simple form of the adjective that is used to describe a single thing.
   My sister is beautiful.
   The dog is cute.
   The flowers are colorful.
2. Comparative: It is used to compare two things. The comparative degree is formed by adding -er to the end of the adjective for short adjectives or by adding "more".
   My sister is more beautiful than my mother.
   The dog is cuter than the cat.
   The flowers are more colorful than the leaves.
3. Superlative: It is used to compare more than two things. The superlative degree is formed by adding -est to the end of the adjective for short adjectives or by adding "most".
   My sister is the most beautiful woman in the world.
   The dog is the cutest animal in the park.
   The flowers are the most colorful thing in the garden.

## Nouns as Adjectives

Nouns can be used as adjectives to modify other nouns in a sentence. This type of adjective is called a noun adjunct or attributive noun. Nouns used as adjectives help to provide more information about the noun they modify.
Examples:

1. Football player - In this phrase, "football" is used as an adjective to describe the type of player.
2. Dog food - In this phrase, "dog" is used as an adjective to describe the type of food.
3. Coffee mug - In this phrase, "coffee" is used as an adjective to describe the type of mug.
4. Ocean breeze - In this phrase, "ocean" is used as an adjective to describe the type of breeze.
5. Tennis shoes - In this phrase, "tennis" is used as an adjective to describe the type of shoes.

## Adjectives with -ly
