## Subordinating Conjunction - Reading
A subordinating conjunction is a word used to combine an independent clause and a dependent clause in a sentence. They help in forming complex sentences. Some subordinating conjunctions are as long as, because, even if, if, unless, before, since, though, etc.
Examples: *Unless* you submit all the supporting documents, your application will not be processed.
I was not able to go to the hospital *because* it was raining heavily.
*When* I reached the railway station, I found out that the train had already left.
*Although* we had parked in the parking lot, the traffic police issued us a parking ticket.
It is better to keep everything packed *as* you are not sure when you would be asked to come to Bangalore.
## Rules
1. Subordinating conjunctions can be used at the beginning or middle of a sentence according to the position of the dependent clause.
2. When the subordinating conjunction appears at the beginning of a complex sentence, a comma is used after the dependent clause.
3. When a subordinating conjunction is used in the middle of a sentence, there is no need for a comma to be used.
4. A dependent clause with a subordinating conjunction cannot stand by itself as it does not make sense.
