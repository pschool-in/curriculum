1. Hyphen: Depicted by '-' is used between two words that are parts of a name or a compound word. For example, long-term, get-together
2. Dash: A dash (—) is a punctuation mark that resembles a hyphen, but is longer. A dash is used to separate parts of a sentence and indicate a break. It indicates a longer pause than a comma and a semicolon.
