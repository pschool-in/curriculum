## Sentence Analysis - Reading

A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought or idea. It must have a subject (who or what the sentence is about) and a predicate (what the subject is doing).
=> Sentences can be classified based on their structure. There are four types of sentences: simple, compound, complex, and compound-complex.

1. Simple Sentence: A simple sentence consists of one independent clause, which has a subject and a predicate.
   Example: John is reading a book.
2. Compound Sentence: A compound sentence consists of two or more independent clauses joined together with a coordinating conjunction (such as "and," "but," or "or").
   Example: I wanted to go to the party, but I had to study for my exam.
3. Complex Sentence: A complex sentence consists of one independent clause and one or more dependent clauses. A dependent clause cannot stand alone as a sentence and depends on the independent clause to make sense.
   Example: Because it was raining, we stayed inside.
4. Compound-Complex Sentence: A compound-complex sentence consists of two or more independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.
   Example: I wanted to go to the park, but it was raining, so I stayed home and read a book.
   => Sentences can also be classified based on their function. There are four types of sentences based on function: declarative, interrogative, imperative, and exclamatory.
5. Declarative Sentence: A declarative sentence makes a statement and ends with a period.
   Example: She is a talented musician.
6. Interrogative Sentence: An interrogative sentence asks a question and ends with a question mark.
   Example: Have you finished your homework yet?
7. Imperative Sentence: An imperative sentence gives a command or makes a request and can end with a period or an exclamation mark.
   Example: Don't forget to bring your passport.
8. Exclamatory Sentence: An exclamatory sentence expresses strong emotion and ends with an exclamation mark.
   Example: Wow, what a beautiful sunset!
