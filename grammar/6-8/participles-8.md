## The Participle - Reading
A participle is a word that is formed from a verb and takes the nature of both a verb and an adjective.
e.g. Looking at the snake, Maria screamed and sprang up out of his chair.
In this sentence, ‘looking’ is the present participle (look+ing) which qualifies the noun ‘Maria.’ Hence it acts like an adjective. It is formed from a verb and also denotes the action of looking. Hence it acts as a verb too.
1. Present Participle: It is formed by adding ‘ing’ to the original form of the main verb.
e.g. Knowing, following etc.
2. Perfect Participle: It shows that the action is complete, either at some time in the past or at present.
e.g.Having walked continuously, I am fully exhausted now.
Having lost his wallet, he had to ask others for help.
3. Past Participle: The third form of the verb is called a past participle.
e.g. Frozen, loaded etc.
Since the participle is a verb-adjective it must be attached to some noun or pronoun. It must always have a proper subject of reference.
