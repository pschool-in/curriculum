## Subject-Verb Agreement - Reading
Subject-verb agreement tells us about the ways a subject will agree to its verb. Generally, rules of tense are in the category of subject-verb agreement, but apart from these rules, there are some other rules by which a subject agrees to the verb.
## Rules for Subject-Verb Agreement
1. Two nouns or pronouns when joined by 'and' takes a plural verb.
Example: You and I have done this.
2. When 'one of' is used with a plural noun, the verb after it is always singular,
Example: One of my friends is sick.
3. Nouns that are connected by 'each' and 'every' takes a singular verb with them.
Examples: Each boy was given a prize.
Every day is a battle here.
4. If two nouns are connected by 'and' but are meant for one person or one idea then the verb becomes singular.
Example: Time and tide waits for no one.
5. When two subjects are joined by 'as well as, along with, together with, in addition to' then the verb agrees to the first subject.
Examples: She as well as her friends is very pleasing.
The boys together with the coach were practicing for the match.
6. When two or more subjects are connected by 'or, nor, either or, neither nor' then the verb is singular.
Example: Neither Ram nor Sham has eaten.
7. If a sentence starts with introducing 'there' then the verb agrees to the number of the noun that comes after 'there'.
Examples: There is a pen.
There were big rivers.
8. Nouns, though plural but refer to the name of a book, country or province then the verb used is ‘singular’.
Example: The United States is a powerful country.
9. When plural nouns refer to a whole then it is taken to be singular and the verb is also singular.
Example: Two thousand rupees is not a small amount.
10. The phrase 'a number of' takes a plural verb but the phrase 'the number of' takes a singular verb.
Examples: A number of boys were absent.
The number of people there is not much.
11. Few, a few, many, several/both are plural in form and they take plural verbs with them.
Example: Few books are available to me.
12. If two subjects with different numbers are joined by 'not only, but also, either or, neither nor' then the verb agrees to the subject nearer to it.
Examples: Neither they nor that man goes to the park.
Either he or his friends were the culprit.
