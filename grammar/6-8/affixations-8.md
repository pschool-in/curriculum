## Affixation - Reading

An affix is a word element of English grammar used to alter the meaning or form of a word and comes in the form of either a prefix or a suffix.

### Affixation in Comparative and Superlative Degree

1. Most comparative and superlative degrees are made by adding -er and -est. If the adjective ends in -e, only then -r and -st are added.
   Examples: sweet -> sweeter -> sweetest; safe -> safer -> safest; dark -> darker -> darkest
2. Adjectives ending in y, drop the -y and take -ier and -iest.
   Examples: crazy -> crazier -> craziest; early -> earlier -> earliest; happy -> happier -> happiest
3. In some adjectives that have just one syllable, the last consonant is doubled.
   Examples: thin —> thinner —> thinnest; sad —> sadder -> saddest; dim -> dimmer -> dimmest
4. Adjectives that have more than two or three syllables take more and most to make comparative and superlative degrees. These include adjectives that end in -ed, -ful, -less, -ing, etc.
   Examples: excited -> more excited —> most excited; useful —> more useful -> most useful
