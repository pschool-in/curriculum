## Auxiliary Verb - Reading
Auxiliary verbs have no meaning on their own. They are necessary because they help the main verb to form the grammatical structure of a sentence. The main functions of auxiliary verbs are to form questions, short answers, question tags and to avoid repetition.
Auxiliary verbs fall into three basic groups:
1. primary or main auxiliary verbs: The primary auxiliary verbs are called so because they are the most used in forming tenses, negatives and questions. These are forms of the verbs be, have and do.
2. modals or modal auxiliary verbs: Modal auxiliary verbs are also helping verbs. They are used before main verbs to express a range of meanings such as ability, possibility, 
certainty, suggestion, permission, obligation and so on. In almost all cases, the modal verb does not change according to the subject of the sentence. This means that the modal verb need not agree with the subject in number and person. Examples include can, could, may, might, shall, should, will, would, must, etc.
3. other auxiliary verbs with the characteristics of modals: Some words do not always behave as modals.  Such phrases are called semi-modals. Examples include, be about to, be able to, be likely to, had better, have to, ought to, used to, need to, dare and would rather.
