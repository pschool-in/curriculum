## Active and Passive Voice - Reading
Active Voice: When the Subject of a Verb acts, the Verb is said to be in the Active Voice.
Example - I made a mistake.
Passive Voice: When the object of the Active Voice becomes the Subject, the Verb is said to be in the Passive Voice.
Example - A mistake was made by me.
### Rules for changing a Verb from the Active Voice into the Passive Voice
1. The object of the Active Verb is made the Subject of the Passive Verb.
2. The Subject of the Active Verb is made the object of some Preposition (generally ‘by’).
3. The Verb of the Active Voice gets the Past Participle form of the Finite Verb and some form of the verb ‘to be’ [be, is, am. are, has been, was, were, had been, will be, is being etc.) will be used before it in the passive voice.
4. Some vague and indefinite subjects like ‘everyone’, ‘they’, ‘people’, ‘someone’, ‘somebody’, ‘everybody’, ‘anybody’, etc. are dropped if they are the subjects of the active voice. If so, the preposition ‘by’ is also not used.
5. The Tense of the Verb does not change.
The following four types of sentences cannot be changed into passive voice: Present Perfect Continuous, Past Perfect Continuous, Future Continuous and Future Perfect Continuous.
