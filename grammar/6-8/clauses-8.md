## Clauses - Reading 
A group of words containing a subject and a finite verb is called a clause. It is formed when a subject and a predicate are combined to communicate an idea. 
## Features of a clause
1. A clause has a subject and a predicate.
2. A clause has a finite verb.
3. The subject may be both implicit and explicit.
## Subordinate Clause 
Subordinate clauses are introduced by a subordinating conjunction (because, though, however, before) or relative pronouns (who, what, which) that function as subordinating conjunctions. They are mainly of four types.
1. Noun/Nominal Clause: When a subordinate clause performs the function of a standard noun in a sentence, it is known as a noun clause or nominal clause. It can be the subject or the object of a transitive verb, subject complements, delayed subjects or appositives.
Example - Rahima said that she wanted to become an author.
2. Adjective/Relative Clause: An adjective clause does the work of an adjective and modifies the noun, pronoun, or noun equivalent in a main clause or a dependent clause.
Example - Nisha, who is my neighbor, is an actress
3. Adverb Clause: When a verb is modified in the main clause and made to do the work of an adverb, it is called an adverb clause.
Example - Hari came to meet me at the station as I was leaving.
Adverb clauses can be of various kinds, depending on their functions. (Adverb clause of time, place, reason, result, condition, concession, manner and degree)
4. Conditional/If Clause: They are used
    a) to express cause-effect relationships for physical conditions.
    b) to suggest habitual actions.
    c) to show real conditions.
    d) to show actions when certain conditions are fulfilled.
    e) to show willingness and likelihood/probability.
    f) for unreal conditions.
    g) for imaginary conditions.
Examples - If you see dark clouds in the sky, you can expect rain.
Unless you tell me your problems, I cannot help.
If I had come to the party, I could have met my friend.
