## Adverbs and Adverbials - Reading
An adverb is a word that modifies the meaning of a verb or an adjective or another adverb.
### Position of Adverbs
1. Adverbs of manner, time and place are usually placed after the verb, or after the object, if there is one.
Example - The tiger attacked the deer ferociously.
2. Adverbs of frequency are placed between the subject and the verb or between the auxiliary and main verb.
Example - She never gets up before eight o’clock.
3. With forms of the verb be, the adverb is placed after the verb.
Example - I am usually at the theatre on Saturdays.
4. With the auxiliaries 'have to' and 'used to' the adverb is put before them.
Example - I often have to accompany my parents to family functions.
### Adverbials
Adverbials are words or word groups that do the work of an adverb. 
Example - The boy fought heroically.
The term adverbial refers to a word, phrase or clause that functions like an adverb. Besides adverbs themselves, adverbials include adverb phrases and adverb clauses. 
Adverbial Phrases replace the adverb with a phrase that acts as an adverb. Adverbial phrases can be classified into those of time, manner, place, frequency and purpose. For example, the adverb 'politely' can be replaced with the adverbial phrase 'in a polite manner'.
Adverbials can also be clauses, containing a subject and a main verb. An adverbial clause is a dependent clause that does the work of an adverb. Usually, a subordinating conjunction (because, since, after, before, so that, etc.) introduces an adverbial clause.
Example - I met Priya before she started her new job
### Order of adverbials
If there is more than one adverbial after a verb, then their order will be:-
adverbs of manner -> place -> frequency -> time -> purpose
Example- He prayed fervently (manner) at the church (place) yesterday(time).
