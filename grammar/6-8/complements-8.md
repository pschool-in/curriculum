## Complements - Reading
A complement is a word or word group that completes the predicate in a sentence. Subject complements follow a linking verb and provide additional information about the subject of the sentence. The subject complement is normally a noun or an adjective that defines or renames the subject in some way. Object complements follow and modify a direct object and provide additional information about it. An object complement can be a noun or adjective or any word acting as a noun or adjective.

Subject complements and object complements fill out and complete our sentences. Object complements provide more detail about the object of a sentence, while subject complements provide information about the subject of a sentence.
