## Sentence Analysis - Reading
### The Object of a Verb
When we use a verb transitively, we need an object to make the meaning of the sentence complete. Transitive verbs need an object to complete their meaning. When an object consists of more than one word, we have the object word and its attributes just like we have attributes for the subject word.
Example - The mother scolded the naughty child. (Here the child is the object word, and the and naughty are its attributes.)
### Direct and Indirect Objects
Very often, we require two objects with a transitive verb.
Example - Priya gave Reem a book. 
Here we have two objects of the verb gave. When we ask the question ‘Priya gave what?’ we get the answer a book, which is called the direct object of the verb. Now if we ask whom the book was given to, we get the answer, Reem. 
The word Reem is then the indirect object of the verb 'gave'.
### The Complement 
Sometimes, the verb in the predicate is an intransitive verb, but it is incomplete by itself. It requires a noun, a pronoun, an adjective, etc. to complete the predicate. The word or group of words required to complete the predicate is called a complement. The complement of an intransitive verb describes the subject. It is therefore called the subject complement.
Example - Mother seems agitated.
Jake appeared unhappy.

### Direct or Indirect 
Classify the given sentences based on the presence of direct or indirect objects.

## Complements - Reading
A complement is a word or word group that completes the predicate in a sentence. Subject complements follow a linking verb and provide additional information about the subject of the sentence. The subject complement is normally a noun or an adjective that defines or renames the subject in some way. Object complements follow and modify a direct object and provide additional information about it. An object complement can be a noun or adjective or any word acting as a noun or adjective.

Subject complements and object complements fill out and complete our sentences. Object complements provide more detail about the object of a sentence, while subject complements provide information about the subject of a sentence.
