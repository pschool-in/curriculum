## Conditionals - Reading
Conditional sentences express conditions that are required to be followed in order to achieve the desired results. 
1. Conditional Clauses: Conditional clauses begin with if or unless and express a condition.
Example - If you would have studied well, you could have passed the examination easily.
2. Zero Conditionals: A zero conditional sentence refers to a general truth. It denotes situations in which a particular thing or action always results in the other. 
Example - If you don't water the plants, they die
Babies cry when they are hungry and sick.
3. First Conditionals: First conditional sentences are those sentences that express a situation in which the result would be the one to most likely happen. This, however, is not the guaranteed outcome.
Example - If you take some medicines, you will feel better.
If you go out now, you will get wet in the rain.
4. Second Conditionals: Second conditional sentences are sentences in which hypothetical situations or unrealistic events that are not likely to ever happen are mentioned. 
Example - If I knew animation graphics, I would create real-life animated characters.
If I had a time travel machine, I could go back to my past and change a few things.
5. Third Conditionals: Third conditional sentences express alternate circumstances in the present. This is used to indicate that the outcome would have been different if there was a change in the past event mentioned in the dependent clause. 
Example - If you had not fought with me, everything would have been fine.
If the teacher had informed us earlier, we could have finished it in time.
