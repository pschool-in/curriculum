## Grammar Rules - Reading
1. Collective nouns are singular in American English Grammar. British English usually treats collective nouns as plural nouns, so the verb must agree with the plural form. 
British English: The staff are taking the day off.
American English: The staff is taking the day off.
British English: The committee are making the decision today.
American English: The committee is making the decision today.

2. Americans don't use the present perfect tense much. However, British speakers sometimes use the present perfect tense instead of the simple past.
American English: He ate his lunch.
British English: He has eaten his lunch.
American English: I went to the store.
British English: I have gone to the store.

3. Transitive and Intransitive verbs flip in American and British English.
British English: He appealed against the decision. (Intransitive)
American English: He appealed the decision. (Transitive)

4. American English verbs simply need an “-ed” at the end in order to transform them into the past tense. However, British English often adds a “-t” at the end instead of the “-ed.”
British English: learnt, dreamt, dwelt
American English: learned, dreamed, dwelled

5. The use of “have” vs “have got” varies in American and British English.
British English: I have got a dog.
American English: I have a dog.
British English: My job has got better.
American English: My job has gotten better.

6. The usage of modal verbs differs between British and American English. For example, shall and shan’t are almost exclusively used by British speakers, as American speakers find these words extremely formal. Americans use will and won’t instead.
British English: I shall go.
American English: I will go.
British English: I shan’t attend.
American English: I won’t attend.

7. American English changes the position of adverbs quite easily, sometimes placing them before the verb and sometimes after it. On the other hand, British speakers usually place the adverb after the verb.
American English: She drank quickly./She quickly drank.
British English: She drank quickly.

8. In American English grammar, the word “well” is only used as an adverb to mean “good.”
However, in British English, the word “well” can also be used to mean “very.”
British English: I’m well sleepy.
American English: I’m very sleepy.
