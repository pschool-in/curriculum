## Clause - Reading

A clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a predicate, and it can function as a sentence on its own or as a part of a sentence.
A phrase, on the other hand, is a group of words that does not contain a subject and a predicate, and it does not express a complete thought. Phrases can function as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs in a sentence.
A noun phrase functions as a noun in a sentence. For example: "The big red ball."
An adjective phrase functions as an adjective in a sentence. For example: "The girl with the curly hair."
An adverb phrase functions as an adverb in a sentence. For example: "He drove the car very slowly."
