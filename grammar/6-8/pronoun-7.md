## Pronoun - Reading

A pronoun is defined as a word or phrase that is used as a substitution for a noun or noun phrase, which is known as the pronoun’s antecedent. Pronouns are short words and can do everything that nouns can do and are one of the building blocks of a sentence. Common pronouns are he, she, you, me, I, we, us, this, them, that. A pronoun can act as a subject, direct object, indirect object, object of the preposition, and more and takes the place of any person, place, animal or thing.

## Types of Pronouns

   Examples: here, there, where, everywhere, nowhere, somewhere, etc.
2. Pronouns of Time: These pronouns are used to indicate the time or duration of an action or event.
   Examples: now, then, soon, later, yesterday, today, tomorrow, etc.
