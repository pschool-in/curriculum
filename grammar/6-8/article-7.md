Mr. Sheetal Das is my *x* neighbour. He is *a* businessman. He owns *a* spacious bungalow and *a* car. His house is well furnished. It is equipped with all *the* comforts of life. I am, however, sad to see that he does not have very good relations with his *x* neighbours. Once he called *x* police against one of his neighbours. It happened just because he thought that his neighbour’s children had broken his window glass. *The* children had of course denied it. He has *a* servant. This poor boy is not given enough food to eat. He never donates any money for any cause. I wonder why he behaves in such *an* ignoble manner. May God grant him *x* wisdom!

My school owns *a* good library. It has two rooms. One of these rooms is called *the* reading room. Here, *the* students sit and study quietly. *The* other room is bigger. In one of its parts, there are several cupboards full of *x* books. Each cupboard has *a* special branch of knowledge hidden within *the* books. I am very fond of *the* cupboard which contains story books. *The* library has books suited to students of all age-groups. *The* library is *a* great source of pleasure and knowledge. *A* school without *a* library is like *a* kitchen without *x* food.

My favourite season is *the* Rainy season. In *x* India it is *a* very important season. *The* agriculture in *x* India depends largely on *the* water given by *the* rains. For me it is *the* most colourful of all the* seasons. One can see a lot of greenery around oneself. *The* dark clouds are *a* great blessing and are eagerly awaited after *the* scorching summer heat. *The* best part of *the* season is that one gets a lot of unexpected holidays and off from *the* school due to *the* rains. It is *a* pleasure to go out in *the* rains and get wet in *the* water.

*x* Examinations are always fearful. They are *a* great cause of fear, anxiety, tension and worry. *The* night before *the* examination is really painful. *The* students have no sleep. They stop eating *x* food. They want to read and revise everything. They are disturbed if someone tells them about *an* important question. They at once study for its answer. They are irritated also if someone disturbs them. They pass *the* whole night in tension. They do not take anything in *the* morning. They go to *the* examination hall on *x* empty stomachs.

*The* scene at *a* Railway Platform is always enjoyable. It presents *a* picture of *x* mini India. Last Sunday I went to *the* city Railway station to see my uncle off. *The* platform was overcrowded. Passengers of all states like *x* Rajasthan, *x* Tamil Nadu, *x* Assam etc, could be seen. There were many stalls on *the* platform. Small children were running here and there. Coolies in *x* red dress were going to and fro. Passengers were taking *x* tea. Some people were reading *x* newspapers. They were waiting for *the* train. Soon *the* train came. My uncle got *a* seat and *the* train started. I returned home.
