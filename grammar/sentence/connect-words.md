```
we are happy
it is dark
dog is hungry
they are coming
I am a boy
I live in Mumbai
please come in line
we are watching tv
they are playing cricket
I am reading poems
```

```
we have holiday tomorrow
I am drinking water
the dog is barking
the crow is thirsty
the bird is wounded
people are living happily
I have a beautiful pet
he lives in a big city
honesty is the best policy
I am going to Chennai
```

```
I am sitting in sofa
Siva is sleeping in bed
the cat is drinking milk
I am thinking of icecream
sun rises in the east
I am playing with my friends
I have not done my homework
I saw a very beautiful puppy
Ravi is very good in math
English is not my favorite subject
```
