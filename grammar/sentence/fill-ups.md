Two men *were(was,is)* walking along one summer day. Soon *it(they,is)* became too hot to go any further. seeing *a(an,the)* large plane tree nearby, they threw themselves on the ground to rest in its shade. Gazing up into *the(a,an)* branches one man said to the other that the tree is(are,were)* useless. It does not *have(has,has)* fruit or nuts that we can eat. we cannot even use *its(their,them)* wood for anything.Suddenly *the(a,an)* tree replayed him *(his,her)* not to be so ungrateful. It also said at *this(that,these)* very moment the tree *is(was,it)* very useful for them because it is shielding them from the hot sun. but he called *the(a,an)* tree good-for-nothing. The man who commented on the tree realised *his(him,her)* mistake and apologised to the tree.

Once upon a time, there *was(is,are)* a king who ruled a prosperous country. One day, he went for *a(an,the)* trip to some distant areas of *his(her,their)* country. When he *was(is,are)* back to his palace, he complained that *his(their,they)* feet were very painful, because it was *the(a,an)* first time that he went for such a long trip, and the road that *he(she,it)* went through was very rough and stony. *He(his,she)* then ordered his people to cover every road of *the(a,an)* entire country with leather. Definitely, this would need thousands of cows’ skin, and would cost a huge amount of money. Then one of *his(her,him)* wise servants dared himself to tell the king not to waste huge money unnecessarily. Instead, a little piece of leather can be used to cover *the(an,a)* king’s foot. The king was surprised, but *he(she,it)* later agreed to his suggestion, to make a shoe for himself.

The Lamb *that(these,this)* belonged to the sheep, whose skin the Wolf *was(is,wear)* wearing, began to follow the Wolf in the Sheep’s clothing. so, leading the Lamb *a(the,an)* little apart, he soon made a meal off *her(hers,it)*, and for some time *he(she,hers)* succeeded in deceiving the sheep, and enjoying hearty meals. 


Once there lived *a(an,the)* grumpy king. *He(she,him)* never used to laugh nor allow anyone in the kingdom to laugh. One day, *a(the,an)* small boy couldn't control *his(him,her)* laughter. Later, scared of the punishment, he thought of *a(an,the)* plan. He wrote a funny story *and(but,yet)* converted it into a drama. Then he went to the palace and asked *the(a,an)* king for permission to enact the drama. the king let *him(her,his)* do it. Then *the(she,him)* boy started the play. In *the(an,a)* end, he came to the funniest part of the story which made the king laugh. All people present in the court *were(was,is)* amazed. The king then allowed everybody *to(for,with)* laugh. Everyone *then(they,their)* lived happily thereafter.

He will save *him(his,her)* from all problems.*The(this,a)* disciple obeyed and resumed his journey. He kept reciting *the(an,a)* name of god and cleared all the hurdles.

Once upon a time, beside a lake, *there(here,these)* lived a tortoise and two geese who *were(are,was)* great friends. As the lake *was(is,am)* drying, the geese decided to migrate to*a(the,an)* new place. The tortoise also wanted *to(for,on)* move with them, but *he(they,their)* couldn’t fly. so he pleaded *with(on,as)* the geese to take him with them. After trying really hard to convince *them(they,him)*, finally, the geese agreed. They held *a(the,an)* stick with their beaks and asked the tortoise to hold the stick with *his(their,them)*  mouth, warning him to not open his mouth and let go of the stick. As they flew high, some onlookers thought *that(they,them)* the tortoise was kidnapped and commented that the tortoise *is(was,were)* poor.This angered the tortoise and *he(they,his)* immediately opened his mouth to say something back. As soon as he did*(does,do)*, he fell to the ground and died.

Once upon *a(an,tha)* time, a jackal wandered away from *his(them,they)* jungle and reached a deserted battlefield. He *was(is,were)* very hungry, and so he started looking *for(in,to)* food. He heard *a(an,it)* strange sound. The jackal got scared and decided *to(it,on)* run away, but then he thought, let *him(you,me)* carefully see who is making that sound. As *he(I,you)* looked around, he found *an(a,the)* abandoned drum lying next to a tree, and as *the(an,a)* wind blew, the branches of the tree rubbed against "it(you,her)*, making the sound. He *was(is,were)* relieved and continued to search for food.

A gang of owls attacked some crows *in(with,yet)* a forest, one night, and killed them all. Because "the(a,an)* crows couldn’t see clearly at night, *they(it,them)* couldn’t fight back. The King of the crows *was(were,are)* so distressed to hear the news, that he went to *his(her,him)* wise old minister for guidance. The minister gave him some advice *and(so,or)* sent him back.The next day, *the(a,an)* crows went to the owl’s cave and put *on(to,of)* a dramatic show. One crow pretended to praise *the(an,a)* owls and the other ones struck him down. Seeing this, *the(a,an)* Owl King thought that "this(these,they)* crow was in favour of the owls. The crow continued to live with the owls, till one morning, *the(an,a)* crow flew away, and with the help of his crow friends, sets fire to the entrance of the owl cave. Since owls *are(was,were)* nocturnal creatures, they were fast asleep, and all of them *were(is,are)* killed!
