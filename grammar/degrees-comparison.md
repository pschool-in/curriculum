# Degrees of Comparison

## Notes

We use this to compare something.

```
Elephant is bigger than tiger.
```

The above statement has 'comparative' degree. We directly compare one thing with
another.

Sometimes we compare something with the rest of the group. It is called
'superlative' degree.

```
Elephant is the biggest land animal.
```

Sometimes we simply tell something, without really comparing with anything. It
is called 'positive' degree.
