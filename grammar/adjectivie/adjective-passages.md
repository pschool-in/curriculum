## Describing Words

Describing words tell us about the naming word.

## Adjective

Adjectives are words that give more meaning to a noun or pronoun.

Adjectives usually tell us about what kind of, how many, or what color.

Adjectives usually come before a noun and make them more specific.

For example:

```
1. It is a "big" tree.
2. Manish is a "smart" boy.
3. My sister has "long" hair.
```

The words "small", "smart", "long" are called adjectives.

Sometimes, adjective comes after the noun.

```
The table is *small*.
My friend's house is *big*.
The food is *tasty*.
```
