To get familiar with what pronouns are and in what context they're used.

# Pronouns

We are already familiar with nouns. We know that nouns are naming words. Nouns
are names of a person, place, animal, or thing.

Pronouns are the words that replace the naming words. It means that pronouns can be used in place of nouns. The purpose of using pronouns is to avoid the repetition of naming words. Example:

Ishaan is a punctual boy. Ishaan comes to school on time.

In these sentences, 'Ishaan' is the name of a person, .i.e., 'Ishaan' is a noun.
So, we can replace this word with the pronoun 'him'. Therefore, the above
sentences can be written as;

Ishaan is a punctual boy. He comes to school on time.

Different pronouns are used for different types of nouns. Here is a list of
pronouns that can replace different naming words:

```
Man/Boy- He
Woman/Girl- She
Animal/ non-living thing- It
Plural- They, Them
```

Pronouns for 1st person:

```
I, Me, Myself, Mine, We, Us, Our, and Ourselves.
```

Pronouns for 2nd person:

```
You, Your, Yours, and Yourself.
```

Pronouns for 3rd person:

```
He, Him, His, Himself, He, Her, Hers, Herself, It, Its, Itself, They, Them, Their, Theirs, and Themselves.
```

Other pronouns:

```
This, That, These, Those
```

Examples of these pronouns in sentences are:

1. _He_ helps _his_ mother in the kitchen.
2. _I_ like _my_ new toy.
3. Please tell me _what_ the teacher taught in the class.
4. _This_ mobile is _mine_. _It_ is not _yours_.
5. _They_ will cook the food _themselves_.
6. _You_ are _my_ best friend.
7. _Those_ bottles are _theirs_.
8. _We_ will watch a movie today.
9. _It_ is a pretty dress.

All these pronouns are used in different contexts. Do you know that question
words like 'what', 'where', 'who', 'whom', 'when', and 'whose' are also used as
pronouns? We will learn about them in the other playlist.
