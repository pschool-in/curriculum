## Gender Nouns

It helps us to identify the gender of the naming word. There are four types of gender nouns:

1. Masculine:
The names of all male people or animals are called masculine gender nouns. For example, man, lion, hero, uncle, etc.

2. Feminine:
The names of all female people or animals are called feminine gender nouns. For example, lady, lioness, heroine, aunt, etc.

3. Neuter:
All non-living things cannot be referred to as males or females. So, all naming words that are non-living are called neuter gender nouns. For example, book, pen, chair, table, etc.

4. Common:
The naming words that be used for both males and females are called common gender nouns. For example, child, parent, student, etc.
