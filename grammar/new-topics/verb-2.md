# Verb ( Action words) 

## Learning Objective
To be able to understand what is an action word or helping words.

To be able to identify the action words and helping words in the sentence.

## Reading Notes: 

Words which tell us about an action are called action words. Action words tell us about what a person, an animal or thing is doing.  It is used after a naming word or a pronoun. 

For example: 

1. I "play" cricket. ( here play is the action word)
2. Priya "sings" well. (here sings is the action word)
3. Rajeev "eats". (here eats is the action word)
4. My sister "dances" well. (here dances is the action word)

Sometimes action words also end in "-ing" describing what a person or a thing is doing.

For example: 

1. He is "walking".
2. She is "singing".
3. Mannu is "playing".

The words that help us talk about the action are called as "helping words". The words like "is", "am", "are", "has", "have", "had", "will", "should", "would", "may" or "might", etc are placed before the action words.
