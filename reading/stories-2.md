## Unity is Strength

Once upon a time, there was a flight of doves that flew in search of food led by
their king. One day, after flying for a long distance and they were feeling very
tired. The dove king encouraged them to fly a little further. The smallest dove
picked up speed and found some rice scattered beneath a banyan tree. So, all of
them landed on the ground and began to eat.

Suddenly a net fell over them, and they were all trapped. They saw a hunter was
approaching them, and he was carrying a huge club. The doves desperately
fluttered their wings trying to get out, but they could not. The king had an
idea. He advised all doves to fly up together carrying the net with them. He
said that there was strength in unity.

Each dove picked up a portion of the net and together they flew off carrying the
net with them. The hunter looked up in astonishment. He tried to follow them,
but they were flying high over hills and valleys. They flew to a hill near a
city of temples where lived a mouse who could help them. He was a faithful
friend of the dove king. When the mouse heard the loud noise of their approach,
he went into hiding. The dove king gently called out to him, and then the mouse
was happy to see him. The dove king explained that they were caught in a trap
and they needed the help of the mouse to gnaw the net with his teeth and set
them free.

The mouse cut the net and one by one all the doves were free. They all thanked
the mouse and flew away together.

Moral: When you work together, you are stronger.

## The Rabbit and the Turtle

One day a rabbit was boasting about how fast he could run. He was laughing at
the turtle for being so slow. Much to the rabbit’s surprise, the turtle
challenged him to a race. The rabbit thought this was a good joke and accepted
the challenge. The fox was the umpire of the race. As the race began, the rabbit
raced way ahead of the turtle, just like everyone thought.

The rabbit reached the halfway point and he could not see the turtle anywhere.
It was very hot. The rabbit felt very tired and so decided to take a break and
take a (short) nap. Even if the turtle passed him, he would be able to race to
the finish line and run ahead of him. All this time, the turtle kept walking
step-by- step. He decided not to quit no matter how hot or tired he was. He just
kept going.

However, the rabbit slept longer than he had thought. When he woke up, he could
not see the turtle anywhere! He raced at full speed to the finish line but he
found the turtle there waiting for him.

Moral: Never underestimate anyone.

## Two Frogs

A group of frogs was travelling through the woods and two of them fell into a
deep pit. When other frogs saw how deep the pit was, they told the two frogs
that they were as good as dead. The two frogs ignored their comments and tried
to jump out of the pit with all their might. The other frogs kept telling them
to stop, and that they were as good as dead. Finally, one of the frogs took heed
to what other frogs were saying and gave up. He fell down and died.

The other frog continued to jump as hard as he could. Once again, the crowd of
frogs yelled at him to stop the pain and just die. He jumped even harder and
finally made it out. When he got out, the other frogs said, “Did you not hear
us?” The frog explained to them that he was deaf. He thought they were
encouraging him, the entire time.

Moral: There is power of life and death in the tongue. An encouraging word to
someone who is down can lift them up and help them to make it. Also we should do
our best and don’t mind the discouragement.

## Tenali Raman and Two Thieves

One summer night, when Tenali Raman and his wife were about to sleep, he heard a
rustling sound of leaves from outside. There was not even a light breeze blowing
at that time, so he presumed that there were some thieves hiding in the bushes.
He figured out that they must be planning to rob his house in the night.

He thought of a plan and said to his wife, “My dear, I heard that some notorious
thieves are hiding in our neighborhood. So, let’s hide all the jewellery and
money that we have in the well.

A little later, Tenali Raman and his wife came out of the house carrying a big
trunk, and dropped it into the well. Then, they went back inside their house,
and pretended to be asleep. The thieves waited for a while and then started
drawing water from the well.

They wanted to empty the water in the well and get the treasure. The thieves
kept drawing out water, the entire night. Towards dawn, they managed to pull out
the trunk, and when they opened it, they were extremely shocked and disappointed
to see only some big stones in it.

They understood that it was Tenali Raman’s plan to outsmart them. Just then,
Tenali Raman came out of his house and said, “Thank you friends, for watering my
plants. I must pay you for your labour.”

Hearing this, the thieves fell at Tenali’s feet asking for forgiveness. They
promised not to steal or rob anyone ever again. Tenali decided to let them go.

Moral - Keeping cool and using your wit during dire situations can help you to
get out of them.
