        text: `Just as a dash of pure light that strikes through the sky, thoughts on purity occupied my thoughts.   The white colour on our flag reminds me once again about the purity that must rule our thoughts, rule our land, rule the world and finally rule the entire universe.  To recollect – Do we breathe in pure air every day?  - Do we drink pure water every day?  - Do we leave our dear ones pure space to live?   The word 'pure' now has a meaning that has grown enormous and it leaves every nook and corner of a human mind with too many questions.  
          Purity in thoughts; Purity in deeds; Purity in words; Purity in dialogues; Purity in work place; Purity in living space; Purity in footsteps; Purity in pathways.   Purity has become a demanding need of the hour for everywhere we go we are encountered with something impure.  Love for a sophisticated and materialistic life has left us impure.   Though we don't do things wantedly, the end result glares at us – with our own deeds we have triggered the nature's alarm bell.  It is time to wake up with broadened shoulders and thoughts to embrace and welcome purity everywhere.   Let us not leave behind something impure to make us live pure.`

        text: `Look at the familiar doll of three wise monkeys.  What do they tell us?  Don't speak unclean words, don't see unclean situations, don't hear unclean dialogues. Cleanliness is the need of the hour.  Every one of us strive our level best to keep ourselves clean, to wear clean clothes, and to live in a clean space. Yet, knowingly or unknowingly we leave the space around us unclean.  That is something 100% true.  
          In today's context,  the doll of three wise monkeys impart more significance.  The sophisticated life style that we all enjoy prevents us to spare some seconds to think about the future.  For a secure future, we insure our lives.  Do we tend to insure and ensure a clean space for our future generation to live a healthy life?  Sophisticated machines and technology may make our life comfortable and happy.  Yet, think about this – will they assure us and our children a healthy space with pure air to breathe, pure water to drink, and pure food to eat?  Unlike loads of money to spend, let us take an oath to give our children a cleaner world to play, live and be happy.`

        text: `This week, when we went for our usual morning walk at the nearby beach, we were surprised to spot some dolphins. We felt happy to watch the friendly dolphins, which leaped four feet and turned around three times in the air.  One of my friends, a marine biologist, told me that they are spinner dolphins. The mammals looked slender with long thin-beak and a distinct stripe connected the long and pointed flippers to the eyes. 
          Spinner dolphins are commonly found in the tropical and sub-tropical oceans.   He also told me that only spinner dolphins can spin several times in the air. They frequently jump high out of the water and spin around like a spinning top. Some scientists believe that the spinning behaviour is a way of communicating with the other spinners. It may also show the alertness and communicate the school where they are. This acrobatic jump may also help the spinner dolphins to free their food that can be attached to other large fish. 
          According to some resources from the net, I found out that the morning times are the celebration time for the spinner dolphins as they play together. The spinners touch and rub each other and engage in playful games. They swim underneath one another and move their pectoral fins back and forth. Some spinners hold hands with their flippers and caress each other with their tail flukes. 
          Spinner dolphins may differ in body size, shape and color patterns. But, in general they have common characters, namely, slender bodies, long and thin beak, small flippers pointed at the tips, and appeared in dark gray, light gray and white colors. Most of these spinner dolphins have white bellies. Spinner dolphins have 45 to 65 teeth, which are pointed in each side of the upper and lower jaws.  The spinner dolphin feed on small fishes and squids. The female spinners reach sexual maturity at the age of 4 to 7 years and the male spinners reach maturity at the age of 7 to 10 years.  The newborn calves measure 80cm in length.  The female spinner dolphins nurse their calves from one to two years.`

        text: `The world will not be a beautiful place if it is without flowers. Flowers with their varied colors and perfume tell the human beings that the life is here to live and enjoy life as it is. Flowers have the power to make even a shabby place look as a place worth living.  A flower can bring along with it cleanliness, beauty and peace of mind to the place.
          According to wikipedia, a flower is a reproductive structure found in flowering plants. The four main parts of a flower are the calyx, corolla, stamen and pistil. The parts of a flower are arranged in a circular pattern called a whorl.  Calyx is the outer whorl of sepals. Calyx is green in color and in some plants it looks like a petal. As a collective unit the sepals form a calyx, and the petals form the Corolla. 
          The Corolla is the inner whorl of petals. The petals are thin, soft and colorful to attract insects for pollination. A whorl of stamens consists of a bunch of filaments. Each filament is topped by an anther, in which pollen is produced. The pollen contains the male gametes. The pistil is the female part of the flower. The pistil has the carpel, which is the female reproductive organ of a flower. The sticky tip of the pistil is called stigma and it receives the pollen grains. 
          The floral structure of every plant is different from the other. The main parts of a flower are described by their position and not by their function. It is surprising to note that all the flowers do not have all the four main parts of a flower. Some flowers lack some parts or sometimes they are modified for some specific function. The floral formula is used by the botanists to represent the structure of a flower. Specific letters, symbols and numerals are used to describe the structure of a flower. 
          Ca – calyx
          Co – corolla
          A – androecium
          G – gynoecium
          Many flowers are used as symbols with specific meanings. Red roses are considered as symbols for love, beauty and passion. Daisies are considered as symbols for innocence. Lilies are considered as symbols for resurrection and life. 
          Jasmine is also considered as a symbol for love. Orchids are symbols for perfection, and sunflowers are considered as a symbol for infatuation. In Hindu mythology, Lotus is considered as a symbol for fertility, purity and creation. `

        text: `Pranny ran to the school bus with a hop. Her friends greeted her with a loud cheer.  One by one they got into the bus. Luckily Pranny got the window seat.  Pranny always liked to sit near the window. She loved to count the number of trees that crossed their bus. Pranny started to count the number of trees when their bus entered into the main road.  Pranny had finished counting one hundred when they reached their picnic spot. Pranny and her friends jumped down from the bus and entered the park with a scream that can bring down the buildings. Luckily, there were no buildings and the wide sky echoed back their scream. Pranny's teacher asked them to form a line and walk in pairs. Holding the hand of the partner, everyone started to climb up the path on the hill. 
          Once they reached the plain surface at the top of the hill, everyone started to collect different types of flowers and leaves as their specimens. After some time, Pranny found out that she had walked away from her friends. Not a bit worried, she started to collect her flowers. Suddenly she heard the galloping sound of a horse. A wild pony came galloping toward her.  Pranny wanted to move away from the horse. So, she started to run. But, instead of running away from the horse, Pranny started to run toward the horse.  The shocked pony stopped and looked at her.  Then, with a wild cry, the pony turned away from Pranny and climbed down the hill galloping in speed. It took a while for Pranny to come to her senses. Then with a cool shake of her shoulders, she started to collect her flowers once again.`

        text: `The mother lizard slowly climbed the open shelf at the corner of the kitchen searching for a place to lay her eggs. For the past two days it hunted for a safer place where she could keep her eggs. The top corner of the shelf proved to be a safer place. Some bottles filled in the space and hid the corner of the shelf from the view. It will take at least six weeks for the eggs to hatch.  Once baby lizards come out of the eggs, they can move freely in no time.
          Six weeks later, more than six baby lizards hatched out of the eggs.  All the baby lizards followed their mother outside.  The mother lizard led them to the nearby tree and started to teach them how to hunt small insects as their food.  The last one which hatched from the egg did not want to move away from the hiding place in the shelf. The mother went searching for Tiny.  The little lizard curled up at the corner of the shelf refused to follow her.
          ‘I am not coming.’ Tiny replied to her mother. 
          ‘What are you going to do here? You will not get enough food here.’ 
          ‘It is so warm and cozy here. I don’t want to come out and freeze in the cold.’ Tiny replied sharply.
          ‘Freezing cold? Who told you so? Come out and see yourself.’ The mother lizard called Tiny once again. 
          ‘Is it not winter now?’ 
          ‘Yes, but it is not so cold.  If it is cold we can stay inside the garage. People will chase you away if they find you.’ But, Tiny was not in a position to listen to her mother. 
          At that moment, Bob, the cat entered the kitchen. His sharp nostrils told the presence of the lizard. Without making a noise, he jumped on to the flat slab near the sink. Standing near the sink, he looked around searching for a way to reach the top of the shelf. In the mean while, the mother lizard has moved half way on the wall. Sensing danger, she wanted to move fast and escape out of the window. Looking at the cat, she moved her tail fast and let a part of the tail break away.  The tiny piece of tail fell on the floor of the kitchen and it started to wriggle as if struggling for life. Bob jumped down and sat down looking at the wriggling tail. Tiny was silently watching all these things. Without making any more comments, she silently followed her mother and went out through the kitchen window.`

Gracefully the clouds sailed through the sky.  Gazing continuously at the full moon made her feel calm at heart and it also helped her nerves to settle down with a rhythm. Suddenly a ray of light started to descend from the sky. The thin ray of light slowly got dispersed and touched the top of a coconut tree.  The coconut leaves slowly moved in the evening breeze and sent the light in every direction. The pale colored light rays slowly deepened to illuminating green light.  The green light which struck the coconut tree started to move toward Mini.
          The dazzling brightness of the light made her eyes blink for a while. The bright light touched her feet. Something moved in the green light and reached her. As if walking through a long corridor, a small doll like figure walked out of the green light. In the darkness, she could not make it out how it looked like. 
          Mini stooped down to see clearly how the little figure looked like. The first thing that Mini noticed is the strong smell that came from it. The aroma roused and spread all around her. Mini felt to be standing inside a circle of hypnotic power. Her skin started to breathe out tiny drops of sweat and her palms became wet with sweat. She wanted to open her mouth and speak to the little alien like creature. Her tongue struggled hard to move but she could not open her mouth. 
          Millie, the alien, looked at Mini.  The eyes without any eye brows looked at her. It sent a vibration throughout her body. Mini felt hot and cold at the same time, and a strange feeling went down her spine. While Mini struggled with such a sensation, chilled spray of water splashed at her face and dribbled down her chin.  Mini suddenly came into senses. The overflowing water from the water tank has helped her to come out of the trance and break the magic spell from the alien. Within seconds the green light started to ascend toward the sky and disappeared from sight. Mini slowly tried to recollect what happened to her. But, she could not do so. Her memory cells wiped clean of whatever that has happened a few minutes ago made her look blank at the wide blue sky. `

          As usual, he is late for school. Running down the stairs, he reached the table. Throwing bread crumbs all around, he finished his morning breakfast.
          ‘Sit down and drink your juice’ His mother screamed at her. Every morning is a struggle with him. Till he gets into the school bus, the whole place will look like a fighting pit.
          Sitting down on the chair, Joe started to sip the fresh juice. Down near the left corner of the table, a little ant scrambled on its way. Attracted by the bread crumbs that Joe spilled around, it moved near to pick up a large piece. Some bits of crumbs stood on the polished shoes of Joe. Surprisingly, the little ant wanted to carry that crumb home. The little ant slowly climbed on the left shoe. When the ant reached the top of the left shoe, Joe finished drinking the juice.
          ‘Ma, bye, bye.’ Joe started to walk toward the door. The little ant shocked at the sudden jerk, held tightly to the threads of the socks. The bread crumbs fell down on the floor, but Neemoo, the little ant could not climb down the shoe. Breathless, it stayed at the top of the shoe.
          When Joe climbed into the bus, Neemoo lost the grip and fell on the last step of the bus. The door of the bus closed and started move toward the school where Joe studied. Neemoo stretched his feelers to know where he is. Neemoo heard the shrilling scream of little boys and girls. Neemoo moved here and there on the last step of the bus. After walking around few circles, Neemoo decided to rest at the corner of the step. Neemoo lived in the corner of the dining room at Joe’s house. He has never gone out of the dining room. Even if he goes out to the window sill, some ants always came along. This is the first time Neemoo is away from the home and traveling in the bus.
          After the children went to the school, someone started to clean the bus. Neemoo did not know what to do. He moved into the interior corner of the step and stayed there without moving a leg.`
