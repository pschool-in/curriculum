I feed her every day in the morning. When I go near the tank, she will swim fast here and there. I know she is happy to see me. My pet knows me. It may be a surprise to you. But, it is true. Come home to see my pet.`

Two little leaves in light green colour. The stem looked white and tender. I can see the seed with its seed coat under the leaves.  The baby plant swayed in the soft breeze.  Hello, baby plant!`
