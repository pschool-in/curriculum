        text: `Ever since she was little, Aruna was curious about how things work. She loved breaking and fixing things to learn more about them. Radios, bicycles, clocks - whatever she could see, Aruna had taken it apart.
          Sometimes, she was able to put the things back together properly. Other times, they did not work when she was finished with them. Aruna's parents would be amused when they found her busy looking at gears, springs and wires.
          They would bring her broken things from around the neighbourhood. She would work on them and fix them. The neighbours began to call her 'Miss Fix-it'. When Aruna got older, she went to an engineering college. Her lifelong love of exploring things helped her in studies. She studied very hard and graduated with excellent grades.
          Now, Aruna works as a toy designer. That makes her quite happy. When she has an idea for a new toy, she creates a design and builds a model in her laboratory. Aruna likes having a job that is fun and makes children happy. It is a good thing for children to see Aruna's curiosity. They can learn from it too.`

        text: `Abraham Lincoln was one of the greatest Presidents of United States of America (the USA). He removed slavery from his country forever and kept it united.
          In those days in the USA, the blacks (dark-skinned people from Africa) were treated as slaves by the whites. The people in the northern states wanted to remove slavery. People in the southern states wanted to continue owning slaves.
          Slaves, mostly blacks, were bought and sold as property. They lived in very poor conditions. They had no personal or civil rights. The people in the south wanted to have their own country where they could still keep slaves.
          Lincoln opposed slavery. He argued that blacks had the right to life, freedom and happiness. He did not allow the southern states to form their own country. As a result, the northern and southern states went to war with each other.
          The war ended after four years and the north won. The country remained united. Slavery was made illegal in the USA. Lincoln issued a proclamation that freed all the slaves in the south.
          Lincoln was re-elected as the President. But only six days after the end of the war, Abraham Lincoln was shot dead. 
          Abraham Lincoln was a great leader. He was honest, hard-working and a great visionary. He kept the country united. People still remember him and celebrate his life.`

        text: `Singapore, a small island nation, was ruled by other countries. It got separated from Malaysia and got independence in 1965. Singapore did not have many natural resources. So how did it become one of the world's most powerful countries?
          The success of Singapore is due to the efforts of Lee Kuan Yew. He is often called the founding father of Singapore. Lee Kuan Yew became the country's first Prime Minister.
          He was in office from 1965 to 1990. For 25 years, he was the Prime Minister. 
          So what did he do that transformed Singapore to an advanced nation?
          Singapore is a port, a place where shipping activities take place. Lee used this as an advantage for Singapore. The port was used for many trading activities. He made good policies which got other countries to do business with Singapore. He provided housing and employment to his own people.
          Many people think that Lee's style of working was too controlling. He had a strict control over the press. He did not allow much freedom of speech. He took all the decisions and did not allow any corrupt practices.
          In an interview Lee Kuan Yew said, "You are entitled to call me whatever you like, but that doesn't make me one. Do I need to be a dictator when I can win, hands down?"
          He made Singapore a country where there is system and order. Lee Kuan Yew is rightly called the man who created Singapore. He is considered the architect of modern Singapore. He was a great world leader. He died at the age of 91 in 2015.`
