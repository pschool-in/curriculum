## Tenali Raman and the Horse

Once, the King wanted to expand his army. So, he needed more horses. He decided
to give one horse to each person in his kingdom to take care of. He also gave
everyone a good supply of straw to feed the horse. Everyone except Tenali Rama
was not happy with this plan. He shut his horse in one room and everyday at
exactly nine o’clock he gave the horse very little straw through the window. He
gave the remaining straw to his cows that became fat and healthy.

At the end of a year, the king wanted to see all his horses. All the people who
were given horses to take care of brought their horses for inspection. But,
Tenali Rama did not bring his horse. On being questioned, he answered that his
horse had become so strong that he could not bring it to the court. The king was
surprised on hearing this. He said, “Alright, I will send my chief inspector to
your house tomorrow morning at nine to inspect the horse there.” Tenali agreed.

The next morning, the chief inspector went to Tenali’s house. He had a long
beard. Tenali took him to the room where the horse was kept and asked him to
look through the window. When the inspector peeped through the window, naturally
his beard went in through the window first. Seeing the beard, the horse thought
that it must be straw that was being given to him at the fixed time. It caught
hold of the beard in his teeth and pulled. The inspector shouted in pain and
tried to pull his beard back. But the horse knew that this was the only food he
would get all day and pulled with all his might till the inspector lost his
beard.

The inspector went running to the king. He reported that indeed Tenali Rama’s
horse was the strongest of them all.

## Tenali Raman and the Cat

The country faced a major problem of rats. Rats had multiplied to a very large
number and were creating a lot of destruction. They were nibbling through
important papers, clothes, grains in food stores, etc. There were not many cats
in the kingdom to catch all the rats. So, the king asked all the houses in the
country to keep one cat each. But cats feed on milk and not every house owned a
cow to get the milk. So, the king also gave a cow to every house. The people
were happy and took care of cows and cats. They used to give a lot of milk to
their cats.

But Tenali Raman was a lazy fellow and he was also very fond of drinking milk.
He wanted to keep the milk from the cow for himself. So, he thought of a clever
trick. He boiled the milk and poured it in a pan. Then, he put this pan in front
of the cat. As soon as the cat touched the boiling hot milk with its tongue, its
tongue got burned and it ran away at once.

Tenali repeated the same thing the next day and again the day after that. After
a few days like that, the cat refused to touch the milk that was offered to it
for fear of getting its mouth burned. In this way, Tenali got to drink all the
milk himself.

One day, the king ordered all the cats to be brought before him for inspection.
While all cats were fat and healthy, Tenali’s cat looked thin and weak. The king
was very angry with Tenali for not taking proper care of the cat. But Tenali
pleaded, “Your Majesty, I cannot help it. My cat does not drink any milk at
all.” The king said, “Nonsense, I will put you in prison for telling a lie.”
Tenali requested the king to give him a chance to prove it and the king agreed.

So, Tenali brought his cat and the pan of milk in front of the king. He offered
milk to the cat. But on seeing the pan of milk, the cat ran away, frightened.
The king was surprised at this but he let Tenali go. Tenali lived happily,
drinking a lot of milk by himself.

## Who will Bell the Cat

Once, a huge number of mice lived in a grocer’s shop. They ate the fresh, tasty
wheat, rice, bread, cheese and biscuits that were kept in the shop. They were
having a great time and living easy, comfortable lives, growing fatter
day-by-day.

But, the grocer was concerned about the loss that he was suffering, because of
the damage done to his stock by the mice. So, he thought of a solution and
bought a big, fat cat to keep in his shop.

From that day onwards, the cat began to catch the mice every day. The mice were
terrified of even stepping out of their holes. They could not reach the food
anymore. This was a great cause of worry for them. They decided to call a
meeting of all the mice in the shop to discuss this problem.

They got together and started thinking. One of them suggested that they must get
rid of the fat cat but no one could think of a way of doing so. So, they kept
thinking of other ways. Finally, one mouse spoke up, “We should tie a bell
around the cat’s neck. That way, whenever the cat is near or is coming in our
direction, we would get to know by the ringing of the bell and we can quickly
run back to our holes.”

This idea was much appreciated by the other mice. They thought that this was the
best plan. They began dancing and celebrating with joy. But their celebration
did not last very long, for an old and experienced mouse said, “You fools! Stop
celebrating and first tell me, who will bell the cat?”

None of the mice had an answer to this question. They had not thought about this
major problem in their plan. This is why it is said that making a plan is one
thing but executing it is an entirely different thing.

Long ago, there lived a cunning jackal. One day, driven by hunger, he strayed

Terrified, he dashed into the house of a dye merchant and accidentally fell into
a tub of blue dye. The jackal was stained blue from head to toe.

Later, when he got back to the jungle, all the animals stared at him in shock.
They had never seen such a strange and beautiful animal before. Seeing everyone
confused the jackal thought of an idea. He proclaimed that he was sent to rule
over the animal kingdom and guard its animals. The animals believed it and

his guardian, and the elephant as his doorkeeper. But, his work was not done.

## The Talkative Tortoise

There once lived three great friends - a pair of geese and a tortoise. One
summer, the scorching sun rays dried up their lake, and they decided to leave
and look for a new lake.

But the tortoise could not fly, so, the geese thought of an idea, where the
tortoise would have to bite on to a stick, which would be carried by the two
geese. The only condition was that the tortoise should not open its mouth, or it
would meet a terrible fate.

Soon, the geese rose into the sky, with the tortoise holding firmly onto the
stick. “Remember! No talking!” said the geese to the tortoise. On witnessing
this, animals on the ground started laughing at the unusual sight. “A flying
tortoise!” they shouted. Unable to control his anxiety, the tortoise spoke out.
“What’re you all laughing about? Oh no! I’m falling!” screamed the helpless
tortoise.

And so, the poor tortoise came crashing to the ground, only to be saved from
death by her thick shell. “If only I would’ve kept my mouth shut, I would be in
a new lake with my friends,” thought the tortoise, as she slowly began her
