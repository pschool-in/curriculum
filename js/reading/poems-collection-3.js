        When winter sets in
        Making everything cold
        Birds decide to fly
        To reach a warm home
        With food to eat
        And a place to sleep!
        To hatch new eggs
        To raise our chicks
        We fly thousands of miles
        And reach with a smile!`

        And chase each other

        Dogs bark and bark

        Dogs find a place

        With pollen on petals
        It flies in the morning
        It flies in the evening
        And sleeps in the night
        On a bed of leaves.`

        When a light rain
        Started to bring in
        A weather so comfortable
        A strange visitor
        Knocked our doors
        “Knock, knock, knock
        Is there someone there”
        I peeped through
        The hole on the door 
        Surprise I opened the door
        For a little dinosaur
        Stood there with a look
        For he wanted me 
        To give my painting brush
        To draw a picture
        That looked like me!`
