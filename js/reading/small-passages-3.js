Birds like Canada Geese and Pelicans fly a long distance. The bird in the front flaps its wings more times. So that other birds need not flap their wings more. They just glide through the air. Is it not amazing?`

Millions of stars are there on the sky.   Stars are scattered on the sky.  Stars appear and  here.  But, do you know, stars appear in a group.  Every group of stars has a name.  For centuries, stars guide sailors while they are sailing. In a rough sea, stars are better guides to reach the shore safely.`

The feelers have receivers to detect the smell in the air. Insects use their feelers to find the level of moisture in air. Some flies use their feelers to measure the speed of the air when they are flying. Butterflies use their feelers to find out the direction to fly.`
