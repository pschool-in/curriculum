          The earth must rest when the day is done,
          The sun may be harsh, but moonlight - never!
          And those stars will be shining forever and ever.
          
          Be friends with the Night, there is nothing to fear,
          Just let your thoughts travel to friends far and near,
          By Day, it must seem that our troubles won't cease,
          But at night, late at night, the world is at peace.`

          A little soil to make it grow
          A little hole, a little pat,
          A little wish, and that is that,
          A little sun, a little shower.
          A little while - 
          And then, a flower!`

          We don't fuss
          We listen when folks talk to us
          We share our toys
          And take our turn
          Good manners aren't too hard to learn
          It's really easy
          When you find
          Good manners means
          Just being kind.`

          turn toward the sky

          A center full of seed
          Give hungry birds

          I can see the grass grow,
          The bright stars, the yellow moon,
          I can see the white snow,
          I can see you!
  
          I can smell the roast meat,
          The fresh bread, the pretty flowers,
          I can smell your dirty feet,
          I can smell you!
  
          I can touch the soft grass,
          The cold ice, the wet rain,
          I can touch the smooth glass,
          I can touch you!
  
          I can taste the crispy apple,
          The chocolate bar, the cream cake,
          I can taste the fresh pineapple,
          I can taste you!`
