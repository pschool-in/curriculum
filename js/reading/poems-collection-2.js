          Sun shines in the day
          When Moon comes in night
          It makes dark sky bright

          Sway slowly in the breeze
          Blades of grass on the way
          Wants me to walk away
          Every step as I walk
          Must save every little thing.`

          Crawling on my desk

          To open my book
          A cute little lizard
          For he thinks 
          He is at home
          And we live with him.`

          They move very fast

          In their tiny mouths

          Tiny little ants
          March their way
          Not talking or stopping
          To store in their nest
          Food for rainy days.`
