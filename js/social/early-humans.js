        title: 'Stone Age',
        text: `In the beginning, humans were not aware of metals. They took several years to discover metals. Our lives today are their gifts. The Stone Age is the period in which Stones were used as weapons.
          # Nature of Human Evolution
          Early humans lived in jungles along with animals. They used stone tools to protect themselves, drive away animals, dig out roots, shoots etc. The most important thing is that they ate everything raw including flesh. They did not know the use of fire in the beginning. At first, dog was their good companion. Wild animals ran away when dogs barked. Dog was the first pet animal.They took it wherever they went.
          Later they started rearing cattle and were very useful to them. They observed some grains growing along the river side. They ate and found them very tasty. They observed that the scattered grains were eaten up by birds. They were keen observers. They found that the grains grow with the help of sunshine and rainfall. Thus, they learnt the art of cultivation.
          Humans noticed forest fire. At first they were afraid of fire. They found some animals died due to fire. They ate the flesh of the burnt animals. It tasted good. They also observed that the spark came out by scratching two stones together. Since then, they ate cooked food. A type of stone called Flint stone was used to produce fire.
          Early man used Quartzite, a type of stone for making tools and weapons.
          # Nomadic Life
          Early humans did not know to grow crops. They wandered in all the landscapes in search of food. They ate whatever they got and drank water from natural sources. This kind of life was called nomadic life. They wore skins of animals, leaves and barks of trees to cover their body. They lived in caves and holes of big trees.
          Stones were sharpened as tools by them. They made it with the help of other stones too. These sharp tools were used to hunt animals and tear their flesh.
          They used bones, horns, stones, skin, branches of trees and sticks as their tools and weapons. This stage of development in history was called New Stone Age or Neolithic Age.
          # Stone wheels
          When the stones rolled from the mountains they acquired a round shape. Humans observed them and thus wheel was invented. In the beginning it was made of stone and later by wood. Wheel is the first scientific invention of man.
          # Pottery
          Pottery was also one of the greatest inventions by humans. The baked pot was strong and looked beautiful. Stone Age people made all the household artefacts by themselves. Stone houses were built. The roofs of these houses were thatched with sticks and husks. After several inventions, humans started to live in a settled life.
          # Agriculture
          Agriculture was an important activity in the history of humans. They started cultivating crops. They sowed seeds and harvested crops. They found it convenient to live along the river as the crops grew well.
          Early humans used weapons to protect themselves from animals. They used torches to find the path at night. They drew paintings of what they saw around them on the walls of the caves where they lived. During this period humans were not aware of scripts.`

        text: `At the end of New Stone Age, copper was invented. In this age both stone and copper were used. This period was called Chalcolithic Age. Bronze was produced when copper, zinc and tin were mixed together. The period when people made tools from bronze was called Bronze Age.
          After this, humans discovered iron and started using iron tools and weapons. This age was called Iron Age. In this age household articles and agricultural tools were made up of iron.
          Pre-historic period is the time before the recorded history. Though humans lived for many thousands of years, we have the recorded history of only two or three thousand years. 
          Pre-historic period is usually divided into Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age. Archaeology is the study of humans lived many years ago, by collecting material evidences.
          # Archaeological excavations
          We get to know about our past by learning through the old objects we get through archaeological excavations. Excavation is the process of digging ground and discovering the things used by our ancestors. And the things made and used by ancestors are called  Artefacts. Coins, potsherds, metal objects and so on are dug out which told lot of things about people lived thousands of years ago. There were burial pots called urns in which the dead bodies were placed and buried under the ground.
          Museum is a place where archaeological objects are preserved, which were used by our ancestors. These give information about the lives of ancient people. Therefore it is important to preserve the remains of the past.
          Numismatics is the study and collecting of coins and the history behind the coins.`
